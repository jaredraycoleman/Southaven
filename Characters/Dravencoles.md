## Description

Dravencoles appears to be in his mid-twenties, his youth tempered by the calm confidence of a seasoned warrior. He has broad shoulders and a solid, athletic build, the kind forged by years of hard living in the cold mountain air. His long golden-brown hair is thick and sun-touched, pulled back in a loose braid over one shoulder, while a short, well-kept beard frames his strong jawline. His piercing green eyes stand out vividly against his warm, weathered skin, steady and watchful beneath dark brows. A simple silver hoop earring gleams in his left ear, adding a subtle glint of personality to his otherwise practical appearance. Dressed in layered leathers and fur-trimmed armor, every piece bears the mark of care and use, and across his back rests a massive, rune-etched warhammer. He carries himself with quiet strength and purpose—like the mountains behind him: steadfast, patient, and unyielding.
## Background

Dravencoles is a rugged human paladin who lives in a secluded cabin near the Seven Lakes in the Eastern Dragonspire Mountains. A man of unwavering conviction, he has taken a solemn Oath of Devotion, dedicating himself to justice, honor, and the protection of the innocent. He is a devout follower of [[Elandria]], the Lady of Light and Mercy, whose teachings guide his path and whose sigil he bears on a worn pendant tucked beneath his armor.

Dravencoles believes in swift justice and has little patience for negotiation with evildoers. His stern and battle-hardened demeanor often sets him apart from the rest of the party, particularly when they engage in haggling or diplomacy where he sees action as the better course. Though he may not speak often, his presence is commanding, and when he does act, it is with decisive force. Despite his grim exterior, he carries a deep sense of duty and honor, making him a steadfast protector of those in need. His faith in [[Pantheon#Elandria, Goddess of Light and Inspiration|Elandria]] gives him strength not only in battle but also in moments of doubt, reminding him that compassion and courage must walk hand in hand.

## Campaign Highlights

**The Hammer of Elandria**: During the daring heist of the [[Emerald Bank]] vault in [[Lusteris]], the party discovered the legendary [[Hammer of Elandria]]—a weapon of divine power meant for a worthy champion of the goddess. Dravencoles has been working to prove himself worthy of wielding it, though his path has not been without stumbling blocks. ([[Session 12 - The Emerald Heist]])

**A Lapse in Compassion**: During the interrogation of [[Talan Windfern]], Dravencoles—frustrated by Talan's panic—suggested killing him. The shocking statement, so at odds with a paladin's tenet of compassion, stunned both the party and [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]]. It hinted that he may have further repentance ahead before he can truly wield the Hammer of Elandria. ([[Session 21 - Speeches, Spirits, and Storm Clouds]])

**Vision of Mercy**: At [[Saint Andral's Church]], Father Tironiel invited Dravencoles to visit Saint Andral's tomb beneath the church. There, he experienced a powerful vision of himself poised to strike [[Talan Windfern]], only to hear a voice reminding him: _"Mercy is Light. Without it, even the brightest flame burns hollow."_ The priest gave him a charm of Saint Andral to remember the virtue of Mercy. ([[Session 23 - Flames of Retribution]])

**Striking Down the Assassin**: During the Durns' attack at the Queen's trial, [[Kaelen Rynn]] leaped from the rafters and began attacking the courtroom. While [[Jesse Durn|Jesse]] and [[Tessa Durn]] escaped, Dravencoles struck Kaelen down with a devastating divine smite, ending the assassin's threat. ([[Session 24 - The Queen's Trial]])

**Radiant Savior**: When [[Talan Windfern]] lay dying from the serpent-creature's venom at [[Aramond's Lookout]], ordinary healing failed completely. [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]]'s holy energy barely stabilized him. The party called Dravencoles back from pursuing the cultist, and the paladin poured a massive wave of radiant magic into Talan, pulling him back from death's door by sheer force of divine will. ([[Session 27 - Confronting Ghorzak the Red]])
