## Description

Ferinthria Everflame is a soft-featured elf with freckled cheeks, bright green eyes, and wavy pink hair that falls just past her chin. She wears a finely embroidered green cloak over a belted tunic and trousers, blending elegance with practicality. Her expression is calm and warm, and there’s a subtle glow of magic in the air around her. 

## Background

An elf sorceress with a divine blessing, Ferinthria was originally from the grand capital of [[Balandel]] but grew up on the outskirts of the mountain city [[Fadrín]]. She is deeply attuned to wild magic and the natural world, carrying an air of quiet wisdom and spiritual resolve. However, her magic is sometimes wild and unpredictable, surging beyond her control in moments of emotion or crisis.

Though kind-hearted, she is not naive. She understands the darkness that lurks in the world and is willing to stand against it. Her connection to nature allows her to fight and protect, but she also has a fierce side when her allies or the innocent are threatened.

Recently, she gained an unexpected companion—a wolf she freed from the grip of cultists and named [[Leonard Chesterwolfe]]. The two formed a deep bond, and Leonard had become a constant presence at her side. However, during the resurrection ceremony in [[Lusteris]], they lost him under mysterious and painful circumstances. The grief still lingers in her, tempered by resolve as she seeks to understand what truly happened and whether some part of him might yet remain.

## Campaign Highlights

**Leonard Chesterwolfe**: In the very first session, Ferinthria freed a wolf from the grip of cultists and formed an instant bond with him. She named him [[Leonard Chesterwolfe]], and he became her constant companion throughout their adventures—loyal, protective, and beloved. However, during a resurrection ceremony in [[Lusteris]], they lost him under mysterious and painful circumstances. The grief still weighs on her heart. ([[Session 1 - The Disappearances in Southaven]])

**Wings of Light**: During the chaotic rooftop escape from [[Baern Ironfist]] in [[Lusteris]], Ferinthria nearly fell to her death. In that desperate moment, her Aasimar heritage manifested—radiant wings burst from her back, saving her life and revealing her celestial nature to the party for the first time. ([[Session 10 - Flight and Revelation]])

**Chromatic Devastation**: One of Ferinthria's most devastating combat spells is Chromatic Orb, which she has used to turn the tide of countless battles. Whether it's a bolt of fire, ice, or lightning, her enemies have learned to fear the destructive power she channels through this spell.

**Leonard's Mysterious Message**: She received a decoded message from [[Lyrian Brightwind]] that simply said: _"Tell Ferinthria I found Leonard."_ The cryptic words haunt her, offering hope that her lost companion might yet be found somewhere in [[Lusteris]]. ([[Session 20 - The Shadow in the Grove]])

**The Marijuana Miracle**: After [[Session 24 - The Queen's Trial]], her wild magic surged and accidentally transformed her into a marijuana plant. Ever resourceful, she made gummies from the leaves and offered them to the perpetually anxious [[Talan Windfern]]. The effect was immediate and lasting—he's been noticeably more relaxed ever since.

**Holy Healer**: When [[Talan Windfern]] was poisoned by the serpent-creature at [[Aramond's Lookout]], ordinary healing magic and even druidic magic failed completely. Ferinthria sensed something was wrong, abandoned her pursuit of a fleeing cultist, and channeled holy energy into him. It worked—barely. Her quick thinking and divine magic were the only things standing between Talan and death. ([[Session 27 - Confronting Ghorzak the Red]])
