## Description

Lirielle is a blue-skinned elf with violet eyes and white hair styled in loose waves. She wears round glasses, a wide-brimmed hat adorned with a purple flower, and a tan coat over a collared shirt, giving her a scholarly, explorer’s look. A book rests in her hands, mid-study, and her calm, focused expression suggests a mind always at work. She is curious, precise, and quietly confident.

## Background

An elf wizard from [[Fadrín]], Lirielle is a scholar and arcane prodigy with a sharp mind and an even sharper tongue. She values knowledge above all else and is endlessly curious about forgotten magic, ancient history, and the deeper mysteries of the world. Recently, she has discovered a growing talent for divination, her insights occasionally revealing glimpses of fate before they unfold (though she is still learning to trust and refine this gift).

While her magical potential is formidable, Lirielle is also practical and calculated, preferring to outthink her foes rather than charge headlong into danger. Her intelligence and analytical nature can sometimes make her seem aloof or overly blunt, but beneath that cool exterior lies fierce loyalty to her companions, especially when their lives depend on her spells.

She also has a gift for negotiation and persuasion, often talking her way through difficult situations. However, her relentless haggling has earned her as much frustration as it has reward from those who dare to bargain with her.

## Campaign Highlights

**The Mushroom Revelation**: In the corrupted grove, [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] ate a hallucinogenic mushroom and began rambling about wishing she could speak Elvish. This sparked a realization in Lirielle—she spoke the words "sun," "moon," "water," and "wind" in Elvish to the ancient druid runes, which glowed and opened a hidden door, revealing [[Talan Windfern]] sealed inside. ([[Session 16 - The Silent Grove]])

**Visions of the Future**: As a diviner, Lirielle has saved the party countless times with her Portent dice—glimpses of the future that allow her to alter fate at critical moments. Whether forcing an enemy's attack to miss or ensuring an ally's crucial spell lands, her prophetic abilities have turned certain defeat into victory time and again.

**Vision of Destiny**: Lirielle experienced a powerful divination vision that led her to suspect [[Sylvara Greenthorn]] would be unable to resist truth serum. During the Queen's private lunch with Sylvara, the truth serum worked exactly as Lirielle foresaw—Sylvara revealed that [[Dessie Pindlehop]] was the real murderer, confirming Lirielle's prophetic insight. ([[Session 18 - A Flower for the Dead]])

**Master of Disguise**: She successfully disguised herself as the cultist [[Serelion Vael]] during the staged interrogation of [[Talan Windfern]], with the [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel|Queen]] watching invisibly. Though Talan simply panicked, the performance demonstrated her growing skill with illusion magic. ([[Session 21 - Speeches, Spirits, and Storm Clouds]])

**The Crown's Chosen**: When [[Laerwen Sylvenblade]] warned [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] that "they think it's me, but it's your friend," she was referring to Lirielle. Later that night, Lirielle put on the [[Crown of Judgement]] herself. Unlike Momeline before her, she felt a surge of agency within the vision it evoked—just as she reached for control, the dream snapped away, leaving her shaken but certain that something greater lay within her grasp. ([[Session 23 - Flames of Retribution]])
