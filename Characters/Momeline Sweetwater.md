![[Momeline Sweetwater_aa1cb6e8.webp]]
## Description

Momeline Sweetwater is spirited young halfling rogue with tousled blond curls, bright blue eyes, and a mischievous smile. Clad in light armor with three daggers on her back, she looks ready for trouble, or to slip out of it just as easily. Her confident stance and twinkle in her eye hint at quick hands, a quicker wit, and a love for adventure deep in the heart of the forest.
## Background

A halfling rogue from [[Brandyburrow]], Momeline left her peaceful home in search of adventure and excitement. Quick-witted and nimble, she thrives on mischief and the thrill of uncovering secrets. With a natural talent for sneaking, lockpicking, and charming her way out of trouble, she brings a playful but pragmatic edge to the party. While her small stature and friendly demeanor make her easy to like, many would be surprised to learn she's just as deadly as she is charming. She's a natural assassin whose precise strikes and stealth make quick work of her enemies.

She also has a habit of collecting souvenirs from her victories, proudly keeping mementos like crocodile teeth, a zombie ogre's tooth, and a boar's tusk as trophies of her adventures. On top of that, she's a surprisingly good drinker, often outlasting burlier adventurers at [[Rusty's Tavern]], much to their shock. Driven by curiosity and the dream of one day having legendary tales told about her exploits, Momeline is always ready for the next great adventure.

However, she carries a strange affliction: a mysterious disease that causes her to involuntarily shift into the Ethereal Plane at unpredictable moments. The origin of this condition is unknown, even to her, and it has haunted her since childhood. In truth, part of her reason for becoming an adventurer is to uncover the truth behind this strange ailment.

### Early Life

Momeline remembers almost nothing from her childhood. She remembers she had a brother and that he called her Momeline. A dwarven man and human woman adopted her when they found her abandoned on a snowy night on a bridge in [[Brandyburrow]]. At this point she already had almost no memory. She told them her name was Momeline and knew almost nothing else. The couple were retired adventurers. They decided to give her the name Sweetwater, after the river by which she was found, to honor her halfling heritage.

%% 

- Birth & Family: Momeline was born near Clover to Jory and Tilda Puddlewick, gentle “hippie” folk. Jory was a mushroom-dyer; Tilda an herbal midwife and beekeeper. Her older brother is Milo Puddlewick (8 years older than Momeline).
- Dragonspire Massacre (Age 3): Jory and Tilda joined a gatherers' caravan into the Dragonspire Mountains to harvest rare moonmilk caps. They and many others were slaughtered not by bandits but by black-cloaked riders seeking. Milo survived by hiding with Momeline in a narrow shale cleft and carried her to **[[Brandyburrow]]**.
- Kettlewort House (Ages 3–5): The siblings were taken into Kettlewort House under Matron Bess (strict, not outright cruel). Two winters later the riders tracked Momeline, calling her "one of the bitch-god's chosen" and stabbed Momeline on the bridge on her way back from school.  
	- This event is the root of her Ethereal condition. She slipped between life and death. After the riders left, she slipped back to life, wandered to the bridge, and was found by the retired adventurers Bram Coppervein (dwarf) and Edda Larkspur (human), her adopters. They gave her the surname Sweetwater after the river by which she was found.
- Milo's Path: Believing his sister truly dead, Milo fled west-to-east, eventually finding the desert folk of [[Khasim's Crown]] (beyond the [[Witchwood]]). He serves with the Sirocco Wardens, defending oases from undead. He blames a necromantic cult for his family's murder, though he doesn't know the details.
- The Blackstar Cult was behind the attacks and was sent to kill all blonde-haired, blue-eyed, female halflings born near Clover. The ordeal resulted in four deaths and made quite the news around the generally peaceful villages. People generally attribute the murders to Nytheris worshippers.

## Unstable Ethereal Shift (Momeline's Condition)

Recently, after a near-death encounter involving the [[Crown of Judgement]], the condition has worsened. She now experiences more frequent and intense slips between the planes, sometimes during moments of high stress or emotional spikes. These involuntary shifts are both a danger and an advantage, and their frequency is beginning to worry her.

Whenever Momeline rolls a **natural 19 on a d20**, she must roll a **d20** and consult the **Ethereal Slip Table**.
### Ethereal Slip Table

| 1d20 Roll | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2       | **Ethereal Banished**: Momeline is pulled fully into the Ethereal Plane for 1 minute or until she uses an action to attempt a DC 15 Wisdom save to return. While there, she can't interact with the Material Plane.                             |
| 3-4       | **Unstable Flicker**: She rapidly flickers between planes. She has **disadvantage on all attack rolls and saving throws** until the end of her next turn.                                                                                       |
| 5-6       | **Spiritual Burn**: The phasing causes intense pain. She takes **2d6 force damage** and cannot take reactions until her next turn.                                                                                                              |
| 7-8       | **Lost Footing**: She slips partially through the ground. Her movement speed is halved, and she cannot Dash or Disengage this turn.                                                                                                             |
| 9-10      | **Ghost-Touched**: Malevolent spirits brush against her. She is **frightened** until the end of her next turn and hears whispering voices no one else perceives.                                                                                |
| 11-12     | **Phase Lock**: She becomes semi-corporeal. She cannot interact with physical objects or attack this round (bonus actions and reactions are also disabled).                                                                                     |
| 13-14     | **Thin Veil**: She can see both planes at once. Gains **advantage on Perception checks**, but **disadvantage on all other checks** until the start of her next turn due to sensory overload.                                                    |
| 15-16     | **Phase Echo**: A ghostly echo of her form lingers. Enemies have **disadvantage on opportunity attacks** against her this round, but she can't take the Hide action.                                                                            |
| 17-18     | **Ethereal Drift**: She harmlessly phases out for a moment. She **teleports 10 feet** in a random direction (roll 1d8) and is considered **heavily obscured** until the start of her next turn.                                                 |
| 19-20     | **Ethereal Surge**: She becomes fully in tune with the Ethereal Plane. Until the end of her next turn, she gains **advantage on all Dexterity checks and saves**, and can move through objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain. |


## Campaign Highlights

**The Crocodile Teeth**: She gifted crocodile teeth to [[Brenlan Kael|Brenlan]] and [[Velara Kael|Velara]] as souvenirs after the swamp adventure. Brenlan was thrilled, while Velara was quietly amused—a small gesture that began her friendship with the Kael family. ([[Session 3 - The Hag of Blacktide Swamp]])

**The Nosy Interrogator**: When the party found [[Velara Kael|Velara]] at the Whisper & Oak Tavern in [[Lusteris]], Momeline's sharp eyes noticed men's trousers in her room. Never one to let sleeping dogs lie, she interrogated Velara about them, her natural nosiness leading to awkward but revealing conversations about Velara's mysterious activities in the city. ([[Session 9 - Masks and Motives]])

**Deadly Precision**: When [[Sylvara Greenthorn]] realized she had revealed too much under truth serum and reached for her blade, Momeline acted instantly—delivering a devastating Assassinate strike. Later, she struck the final blow that killed the ambassador. ([[Session 18 - A Flower for the Dead]])

**The Twin Orbs**: Amid the commotion of the celebration at the Queen's Palace, Momeline slipped into a restricted chamber and discovered the Twin Orbs of Passage—paired artifacts enabling teleportation between them. This discovery would prove crucial during the Queen's trial. ([[Session 21 - Speeches, Spirits, and Storm Clouds]])

**Defender of the Queen**: When Momeline stepped forward to serve as lead defense counsel for [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]]'s trial, few expected the halfling rogue to succeed. But she delivered a brilliant defense, calling witnesses including [[Talan Windfern]], [[Elarin Vess]], and [[Serelion Thorneweave]]. When [[Jesse Durn]] and [[Tessa Durn]] attacked from the rafters and shot the Queen, Momeline thought quickly—she placed the Twin Orb of Passage in the Queen's hands, teleporting her to safety. ([[Session 24 - The Queen's Trial]])

**Turning the Goblins**: Inside [[Aramond's Lookout]], when [[Ghorzak the Red]] ordered his goblins to arrest the party, Momeline convinced them to protect [[Zigra]] instead. The goblins hesitated, caught between their warlord's command and their loyalty to the hexer—but they chose Zigra. It was a pivotal moment that turned the tide of battle. ([[Session 27 - Confronting Ghorzak the Red]])
