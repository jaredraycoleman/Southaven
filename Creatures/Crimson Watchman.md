A **Crimson Watchman** is a hardened mercenary-turned-bandit draped in mismatched armor and marked by the deep red sash of their order—a symbol equal parts threat and identity. They swagger through villages with an air of false authority, shaking down farmers and priests alike under the guise of “protection,” their weapons often scavenged from fallen soldiers or looted caravans. Scarred by past conflicts and driven by greed, Crimson Watchmen fight dirty, favoring intimidation and ambush over honor, and are quick to retreat if the tide turns against them.
