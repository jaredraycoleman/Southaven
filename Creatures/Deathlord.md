A **Deathlord** is a senior commander within [[The Deathless]], a Deathwalker who has proven themselves worthy of leading others. Each Deathlord is bound to a single Tether and commands all Deathwalkers created by it. They receive the willing submission of those who complete the Final Trial—a sacred vow that grants them authority over their followers' actions while demanding they lead with wisdom rather than tyranny. A Deathlord who abuses this trust violates the Right to Submit and may be challenged or overthrown by their own Deathwalkers. Most Deathlords are centuries old, their immortal existence spent guiding new initiates through death and rebirth, maintaining the order's temples, and ensuring the Deathless remain hidden from those who would destroy them.
