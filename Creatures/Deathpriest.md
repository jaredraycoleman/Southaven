A **Deathpriest** is a living cleric of [[The Deathless]], devoted to [[Vaelith]] but not yet—or perhaps never—transformed into a Deathwalker. They serve as the order's interface with the mortal world: tending to secret temples, recruiting worthy candidates, performing the rituals of sacrifice and resurrection, and ministering to those who worship the god of death without seeking undeath themselves. Some Deathpriests aspire to one day undergo the transformation; others believe their purpose is to serve the living and guide souls to Vaelith's judgment rather than to escape it. They possess divine magic granted by Vaelith and often serve as advisors to Deathlords, providing perspective that only the still-living can offer.
