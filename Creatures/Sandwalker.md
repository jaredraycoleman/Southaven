**Sandwalkers** are the restless dead of the desert—corpses desiccated by sun and wind, their skin cracked like old leather and their eyes glowing faintly with baleful light. By day they rise from the dunes, drawn to the warmth of living flesh, staggering across the sands with relentless hunger. At night they sink back beneath the earth, leaving only disturbed ripples where they slumber. Legends claim they are cursed remnants of an ancient civilization, doomed to wander the wastes until the desert itself forgets their names.
