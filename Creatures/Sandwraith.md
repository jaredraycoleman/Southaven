![[Sandwraith_b8e3b1d4.webp]]

Sandwraiths are spectral horrors that drift across the dunes like shadows made of wind and grit. Cloaked in tattered robes of shifting sand, their forms are half-seen, their faces hidden behind whirling veils of dust. They haunt the desert in silence, their presence marked only by a sudden stillness in the wind before a storm of grit engulfs the unwary. Sandwraiths command the [[Sandwalker]]s like puppets, binding them to a hive-like will and raising more from the buried dead. To travelers, they are the unseen masters of the desert’s curse—whispers in the storm, patient and eternal.
