The air is just cool enough that I can walk at the quick pace I enjoy without needing to take off my coat to avoid sweating. I can still smell last night's rain in the air. That and the muddy puddles and slippery cobblestones make my routine route to Edwin's just a bit more interesting this morning. Rain always leaves the town even quieter than usual. I walk in front of the chapel and smile at Eleanor, who is sweeping the front steps. She looks up when she sees me and returns the gesture with a genuinely friendly smile, but the expression from which it came tells me she doesn't enjoy the rain as much as I do.

I don't understand why people don't like the rain. I love it! It makes everything feel fresh and new. It makes your clothes more cozy.

When I turn onto market street, I can see the outsiders waiting outside of the library again. I'm hoping to get into the bakery before they see me so I can chat a bit. I step a bit quieter than I would normally and open the bakery door so as not to set off the little bell I know is hanging on the other side. 
%% Goes to the bakery, has a conversation with the baker about the rain and how busy they are with tourists. I respond saying "I know, even I'm dealing with them at Edwin's! We don't usually get many tourists in the library." %%

%% Goes to the library. The outsiders are there again, but today they have a young half-elf with them too. %%

%% Evening goes to chapel for weekly readings. Introduce Elandria a bit %%

%% Next morning, wake up with back hurting. This is the fourth time time this week, but this is by far the worst. I can barely breathe. %%

%% Go to work, much less enthusiastic. Talk to Eleanor on the way a bit, she says to go to the doctor and she'll send a church boy to put a sign on Edwin's. %%

%% Goes to the doctor, who is busy with tourists, but makes room for him. Doctor says they would prescribe Elenflower, but they were robbed of it all a few weeks ago and no new shipments have come in. Notes that there's alot cheaper ways to make (drug name) but kind of brushes it off saying the bandit guilds must have some use for it. He prescribes something for the pain and sends him on his way. %%

%% Later in the library, he finds a note from the outsiders annoyed that he wasn't there this morning. He kind of brushes it off thinking they're "folgado" but thinks nothing of it. Then he decides to look into the books they are looking at and finds out they have looked at a few items on Elenflower. This is where the investigation kicks off. %%
