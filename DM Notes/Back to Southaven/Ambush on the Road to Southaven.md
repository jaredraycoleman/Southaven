- 200 elven soldiers march south to **Southaven** under **Gen. Landor Vess**.
- 3rd night: camp by river; party near command tent.
- **Perception DC 20**: notice scouts shadowing them. If they notice the scouts, it lowers the DC to notice something going missing on the night of the ambush by 4.
- **Passive Perception DC 14** during rest triggers the ambush.

## Phase 1 – The Silence Falls

- The night goes **utterly silent** — no river, fire, or breath. DC 5 to notice this if awake, DC 20 to notice if asleep. Have the players re-roll perception every round.
- Assassins strike from **magical silence bubbles**.
- **Each round before alarm = 10 soldiers dead.**

**Raise Alarm:**  
Leave silence, cast light/fire signal, or use _Thaumaturgy_, _Message_, etc.

| Rounds | Effect              |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| 1      | Light wounds only   |
| 2      | 10 dead             |
| 3      | 20 dead             |
| 4      | 30 dead + 1 officer |
| 5+     | 40 + panic          |
