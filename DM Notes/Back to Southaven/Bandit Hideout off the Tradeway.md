	### Setup

- Located along the forest road between [[Balandel]] and [[Southaven]], in a narrow gorge hidden behind hanging ivy and a waterfall.
- This is where the assassins and cultists have been operating, ambushing messengers, travelers, and scouts.
- [[Tessa Durn]] is here (recently arrived via _Flamejump Elixir_ from the courthouse).
- [[Jesse Durn]] fled separately. He’s not here yet, but Tessa could be compelled to reveal the plan that he would meet them back here.
- The hideout doubles as a bandit base and cultist shrine to the Black Star.

## Phase 1 – The Approach & Trap

The cave mouth is fairly large and open. Signs of travel (boot prints, wagon ruts) are easy to spot with a **DC 12 Survival** check. A mechanical–magical hybrid trap placed just before the cave entrance.

- **Trigger:** Pressure plate under the mud (DC 15 Investigation or Perception to spot).
- **Effect:**
    - When triggered, **runed sigils** beneath the mud ignite, creating a **burst of flame (20-ft cone, DC 15 Dex save, 4d6 fire damage)**.
    - Simultaneously, a **hidden snare** yanks the front-most creature upward toward the waterfall edge (restrained, DC 15 Strength to break free).
    - Optional enhancement: A **Death Cultist** inside can manually trigger it again as a _reaction_ if the PCs reset it.

If the players detect or disarm it, give them a moment of silence before a **cultist lookout** (DC 13 Stealth) slips away to warn the others.

## Phase 2 – The Hideout

NPCs:
- Tessa Durn: Sleeping in the back room
- 5x Bandit: throughout the cavern
- 1x Bandit Captain: near the front, arguing with a bandit about what to do since the assassin squad hasn't returned
- Wraith: Can be summoned by cultists with two rounds of concentration (dedication).

## Combat & Environment Mechanics

- **Collapsing Ceiling Trap:** In the inner chamber, a there are explosives embedded throughout the cave ceiling. When triggered, the ceiling collapses, requiring players under it to make a DC 15 Dex save or take 4d10 bludgeoning. The terrain becomes impassable. The cultists have a small crawl-tunnel in the back leading out to the forest for them to escape.
- The cultists will also try to summon a Wraith to attack the party.

## Phase 3 – Aftermath & Clues

After Tessa’s defeat or escape, the players can find:

- Crates of stolen goods and dead messenger seals from Southaven.
- If Tessa survives: she may beg for death and for them to have empathy for Jesse. She never intended to lead him down this path. She blames the party for killing her originally, though, and leaving him without his sister.

The party can find [[Daran Grimsby]].

![[Daran Grimsby Blind.webp]]

> A young man sits chained to the wall, head bowed.  
> His eyes are bandaged, his breath shallow.  
> When he hears you approach, he flinches, then speaks — hoarse but steady:
> 
> “If you’re one of them… make it quick.  
> If not… gods, please — get me out.”

If helped or questioned, read this aloud:

> “Name’s… Daran. Daran Grimsby. My father runs the shop in Southaven — William.  
> They caught me scouting the Tradeway. Tried to make me talk.”
> 
> “Southaven’s cut off. Goblins took the farms east of the Aramond.  
> Bandits block the roads. And the cult? They’ve raised their damned flag over the swamp.”
> 
> _(He swallows hard.)_  
> “Tell my pa I kept my word. I didn’t break.”

If dying, read this aloud:

> _(His hand trembles as he reaches out.)_  
> “You… sound kind. Tell him I… saw hope.”  
> _(He exhales — and the cave falls silent.)_

If rescued, he can’t see but insists on walking.

This is what Daran knows about the siege:

- Goblins
    - Massive encampment east of Southaven, at the crossing of the River Aramond.
    - They constantly raid the farmlands east of Southaven, cutting off food supply to the city.
- Bandits
    - Established blockades north and south of Southaven along the Tradeway. Their camps in the Hellrock Hills to the west of Southaven have come out into the fields so that they control the north, west, and south of Southaven.
    - They rob and kill all travelers on the road.
    - Working in loose coordination with the cult and goblins, possibly hired or bribed.
- Runners & Smugglers
    - A few desperate groups try to sneak east through the marshes to move food in and refugees out.
    - They mostly escort nobles and merchants, leaving commoners behind.
    - Cult scouts are actively hunting them.
- Inside Southaven
    - [[Lord Elrin Kael|Lord Kael]] has forbidden anyone from leaving the city, claiming it's to prevent desertion.
    - Morale is collapsing; food stores are dwindling.
- The Blacktide Swamp
    - Strange things are happening around the swamp. [[Daran Grimsby|Daran]] dared not go near, but he saw groups of bandits going in that direction.

[[Seren Valewyn]] can draw this map for the party based on their description and her own scouting.
