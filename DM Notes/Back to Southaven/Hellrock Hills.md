## The Tunnel Exit

The tunnel from the Serpent's Chamber continues for another hour before emerging in a maze of rust-red rock formations, narrow canyons, and winding paths. Easy to get lost. The party can hear voices echoing off the stone—bandits arguing, campfires crackling.

## Bandit Situation

The siege isn't going well. [[Rothgar Red-Hand]] is dead (killed at Fort Hellrock). [[Marta The Knife]] is dead. The northern blockade fell. Morale is collapsing.

**Three Factions Remain**:

| Faction                     | Leader                                    | Loyalty                     | Mood                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Cult Loyalists              | Rothgar's Lieutenant, **Brennan Ashvale** | [[Order of the Black Star]] | Fanatical, desperate          |
| [[Gilded Jackals]] Remnants | **Sera Coldwater**                        | Gold only                   | Ready to cut losses and leave |
| [[Duskrunners]] Deserters   | **No clear leader**                       | Themselves                  | Scared, looking for a way out |

## Overheard Conversations

Roll or choose when party gets close to bandits:

**1. Cult Loyalists arguing**
> "Varnek promised us power. Where is it? Where's the Black Star's blessing now?"
> "Keep your voice down. The enforcers are still—"
> "The enforcers are DEAD. [[Blacksoul Silas|Silas]] hasn't been seen in days. We're dying for nothing."

**2. Gilded Jackals packing up**
> "Sera says we leave at dawn. Take what we can carry."
> "What about the others?"
> "What about them? Varnek's cult boys can burn with their god for all I care. We came for gold, not martyrdom."

**3. Duskrunners in hiding**
> "[[Rothgar Red-Hand|Rothgar]]'s dead. [[Marta The Knife|Marta]]'s dead. Who's even in charge anymore?"
> "No one. That's the point. We just... wait it out? Slip away when no one's looking?"
> "Back to Lusteris?"
> "If the roads are clear. If anyone will take us."

**4. Confrontation between factions**
> Gilded Jackal: "You cultists brought this on us. Your 'Unmaker' hasn't saved anyone."
> Loyalist: "The Black Star tests the faithful. You're just cowards."
> Jackal: "Call me a coward again. See what happens."

## Encounters (Optional)

**Patrol** (2-4 bandits): Nervous, jumpy. Might attack on sight or might try to avoid conflict.

**Deserters** (2-3 Duskrunners): Will surrender immediately if confronted. Just want to leave.

**Cult Fanatics** (2 bandits + 1 cult enforcer): Will fight to the death. Enforcer has black star tattoos and a dagger that deals +1d6 necrotic.

## Treasure Scattered Throughout

| Location | Loot |
|----------|------|
| Abandoned campsite | 45 gp in a lockbox, 2 healing potions |
| Dead bandit (cult enforcer) | Black Star pendant (worth 25 gp to right buyer), Dagger of Necrotic Touch (+1d6 necrotic, 3 charges/day) |
| Hidden cache (DC 14 Investigation) | 120 gp, Silver ring (15 gp), Scroll of Misty Step |
| Sera's abandoned tent | Gilded Jackals ledger (names, routes, safe houses—valuable intel), 80 gp |

## Possible Outcomes

- **Sneak through**: Stealth checks, avoid combat entirely
- **Fight through**: Multiple small encounters, resource drain
- **Negotiate**: Sera Coldwater might let them pass for information about Southaven's defenses (she wants to know if it's worth staying)
- **Recruit deserters**: Duskrunners might be convinced to help in exchange for amnesty

## Exit to Surface

The hills eventually open onto the western plains. From here, the party can see:
- Smoke rising from Southaven to the east
- The Tradeway to the north
- Open farmland (abandoned) to the south
