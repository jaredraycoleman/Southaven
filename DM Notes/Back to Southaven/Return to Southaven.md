## The Return

When the party returns to Southaven, they find:

- Bandits fleeing westward—the siege is collapsing
- Smoke rising from the southern district (destroyed homes)
- Soldiers on the walls, exhausted but relieved

---

## What Happened While They Were Gone

**The Beast Attack**: Another creature emerged from [[Blacktide Swamp]]—a massive serpentine horror. It destroyed a cluster of homes in the southern district before the army brought it down.

**Casualties**: Army now at **103 soldiers** (down from 130).

**Morale**: Mixed. The beast attack was devastating, but the bandits are retreating. People are cautiously hopeful.

---

## The Celebration

Despite the party's absence during the beast attack, the town credits them for turning the tide. [[Lord Elrin Kael]] hosts a modest celebration in the damaged keep.

**Scene Details**:
- Tables set up in the courtyard (great hall too damaged)
- Local food and drink—nothing fancy, but heartfelt
- Townsfolk toast the party as heroes
- [[Brenlan Kael|Brenlan]] sticks close to the party, visibly proud
- [[Velara Kael|Velara]] and [[Talan Windfern|Talan]] attend, both bound by the same secret

**Potential Conversations**:
- [[Rusty Ironbelly]] thanks them, says he's thinking of rebuilding
- [[Gareth Voss]] and [[Lena Alwin]] are together, grateful
- Soldiers share stories of the beast fight

## Elen Tywin's Accusation

Midway through the celebration, [[Elen Tywin]] interrupts.

> "My lord! I demand to be heard!"

She was released from holding (couldn't keep a noble lady locked up indefinitely). She's bitter, humiliated, and looking for revenge.

**Her Accusation**:
> "These so-called heroes disappeared into tunnels beneath YOUR keep, my lord. Secret tunnels. They took your son with them. And now they return, and the bandits flee? How convenient."
>
> "I accuse them of conspiracy. Of making deals with enemies of Southaven. Perhaps they arranged this siege themselves, to position themselves as saviors."
>
> "I invoke my right as a Lady of the realm to demand a formal inquiry. Truth serum. Let them prove their innocence... if they can."

**Lord Kael's Dilemma**:
- He trusts the party, but Elen has invoked noble privilege
- Refusing would set a dangerous precedent
- He reluctantly agrees to the inquiry

---

## The Truth Serum Problem

If the party takes truth serum and is asked about the tunnels, they face a terrible choice:

1. **Tell the truth** → Trigger the curse (someone they love dies)
2. **Refuse to answer** → Look guilty, lose Lord Kael's trust
3. **Find a loophole** → Creative wordplay? (DC 20 Deception with disadvantage under truth serum)

**Key Questions Elen Will Ask**:
- "What did you find beneath the keep?"
- "Did you make any deals or agreements while you were down there?"
- "Are you working with anyone against Southaven's interests?"

## NPC Slip Mechanic

[[Brenlan Kael|Brenlan]], [[Velara Kael|Velara]], and [[Talan Windfern|Talan]] also know the secret. They might accidentally reveal something.

**When to Roll**: Any time an NPC is:
- Asked a direct question about the tunnels
- Put under pressure or stress
- Drunk or emotionally compromised

**Roll**: d20 + WIS modifier

| NPC | WIS Mod | DC to Keep Secret |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| Brenlan | +1 | DC 12 |
| Velara | +2 | DC 10 |
| Talan | +0 | DC 14 (still anxious despite gummies) |

**On Failure**: They say something incriminating. The curse activates.

## Curse Targets

If someone speaks of what they saw, a loved one's heart turns to stone.

| Character                            | Curse Target                                       | Notes                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| [[Dravencoles]]                      | [[Ferinthria Everflame]]                           |                                                        |
| [[Ferinthria Everflame\|Ferinthria]] | [[Leonard Chesterwolfe\|Leonard]], [[Dravencoles]] | Her wolf                                               |
| [[Lirielle]]                         | Eledon Loquehart                                   | The sage who guided her arcane studies                 |
| [[Momeline Sweetwater\|Momeline]]    | **[[Milo Puddlewick\|Milo]]** (her brother)        | He doesn't even know she's alive—and now he never will |
| [[Brenlan Kael\|Brenlan]]            | **[[Velara Kael\|Velara]]**                        | His sister                                             |
| [[Velara Kael\|Velara]]              | **[[Lyrian Brightwind\|Lyrian]]**                  | Her secret lover                                       |
| [[Talan Windfern\|Talan]]            | [[Momeline Sweetwater\|Momeline]]                  |                                                        |

## Possible Outcomes

**Best Case**: Party finds a way to deflect Elen's questions without lying or revealing the secret. Lord Kael dismisses the accusations.
**Worst Case**: Someone slips. A loved one dies. The party must deal with the fallout while keeping the cause secret (or the curse spreads).
**Middle Ground**: Party refuses truth serum, accepts suspicion, and must rebuild trust over time.

---

## Aftermath Hooks

- Elen Tywin becomes a recurring antagonist (or is dealt with)
- The curse hangs over the party—a secret they can never share
- Sythara's vow looms: one day, the Syth'kari will come to reclaim Southaven
- The party must decide: warn Lord Kael somehow? Prepare for the future? Or bury it and hope?
