## The Serpent's Chamber

### The Syth'kari (Serpent People)

**Name**: The **Syth'kari** (SITH-kar-ee) — "Children of the Scaled God"

They inhabited this valley long before Solara's expansion. When Aramond the Watcher arrived (~400 SC), conflict was inevitable. The Syth'kari were driven underground and eventually out of the region entirely, retreating to hidden enclaves in the [[Deadlands]] and beneath [[Blacktide Swamp]]. Their temple beneath what would become Southaven was sealed and forgotten.

The yuan-ti the party has encountered are descendants of the Syth'kari, though corrupted over centuries of exile.

### Sythara, the Coiled Oracle

**Sythara** is a demigod devoted to [[Nytheris]], goddess of darkness and secrets. She was the Syth'kari's high priestess and oracle, bound to this temple as its eternal guardian. When Aramond drove her people out, she chose to remain—sealed in darkness for over 800 years, waiting.

She is not evil, but she is ancient, proud, and deeply bitter. She remembers the valley before humans came. She knows secrets that predate the Kingdom of Solara.

**Appearance**: A massive serpent with an elven woman's upper body, scales of deep jade green, eyes like molten gold. Her voice echoes from everywhere at once.

## The Encounter

### Part 1: The Approach

As the party enters, read:

> *Beyond the door, the air grows cold and heavy with the scent of old stone. The passage opens into a corridor with oddly place ancient statues—warriors in scaled armor.
>
> *The further you walk, the more the walls seem to close in. Then the corridor opens into a vast semicircular chamber. Six enormous serpent heads emerge from the curved wall, each carved from stone but impossibly lifelike. Their jade eyes gleam with inner light, all facing the entrance where you stand.*

### Part 2: The Test

Once the party is in the chamber:

> *Whispers fill the air—sibilant, layered, coming from everywhere and nowhere. The sound of scales sliding across stone echoes in the darkness. Then a voice, ancient and cold:*
>
> "Sso long... sso very long. Do the children of the Sscaled God return at lasst? Or are you more curious filth? Sspeak the words of binding, that I may know you are true."

The "words of binding" are an ancient Syth'kari oath. The party cannot possibly know them.

If they try to bluff, Sythara laughs coldly:

> "You ssmell of ssweat and fear. Of warm blood and sshort livess. You are not Ssyth'kari. You are... invaderss."

### Part 3: The Attack

Sythara attacks. This fight is **unwinnable**—the goal is to petrify the entire party.

**Sythara's Gaze**: Each round, Sythara targets one party member with her petrifying gaze. DC 18 Constitution saving throw or begin turning to stone (restrained). On a second failed save, fully petrified.

Run this dramatically—describe the creeping stone, the horror, the helplessness. Let them fight back, but one by one they fall. Brenlan goes last, calling out in fear as stone claims him.

When everyone is petrified:

> *Silence. The whispers fade. You are aware—trapped in stone, unable to move, unable to speak—but you can still see, still hear.*

---

### Part 4: Yu'man's Testimony

Yu'man steps forward, freed from her bindings (or perhaps she was never truly bound). She prostrates herself before Sythara.

> "Great Oracle. I am Yu'man of the Exiled Coil. We have returned. The invaders' city above is besieged—their walls crack, their soldiers fall." 
> 
> "At last, my child, you have come home. Tell me, champion, where iss your Queen? I would sspeak with her."
> 
> She is back at the nest. She will come once our allies finish taking the city.

Sythara's response is not what Yu'man expects:

> "Allies... with whom have the coil aligned themselves with?"
>
> "The Order of the Black Star. They promised us—"
>
> "SSSILENCE!"

The chamber shakes. Sythara's fury is terrible:

> "You fool. You blind, ssscurrying fool. Do you know what you have done? The Black Sstar sserves the Unmaker. The Void-That-Hungerss. If he returnss, there will be no home to reclaim. There will be NOTHING."

Yu'man cowers:

> "We didn't know—we only wanted—"
>
> "You wanted revenge. And in your hunger for it, you have fed the very force that would devour uss all."

Sythara starts speaking in a language the party cannot understand and then Yu'man transforms into a snake and slithers off in a hurry.

> "I knew I felt it when you entered. Khasim's Eyes, Vaelkor's Touch, The Bitch God's Blessing, and the Wild Spark. The prophecy... the oness who would sstand againsst the Unmaker. I have sseen them in my dreamss. Four mortals, bound by fate."

---

### Part 5: The Vow

Sythara releases the party from stone. They gasp back to life, trembling.

> **"You are not Ssyth'kari. But you are... needed in thiss moment. The threads of fate have brought you here for a reasson."**
>
> **"I will let you leave. But you will sswear to me. Two vowss, binding asss sstone."**

**The Vows**:

1. **The Vow of Silence**: *"You will sspeak of what you have sseen here to no one. Not friend, not family, not god. What liess beneath remainss buried."*

2. **The Vow of Restoration**: *"When the time comess, you will help my people reclaim their home. The land above wass ourss before it wass yourss. You will not sstand in our way—you will sstand with uss."*

If they ask what happens if they break the vow:

> **"The moment you sspeak of thiss place, the heart of one you love will turn to sstone. They will die where they sstand. And the cursse will sspread—to whoever you told, and to those THEY love. Ssecretss have teeth, little oness."**

If they ask what "reclaiming their home" means:

> **"The city you call Ssouthaven sstandss on ssacred ground. One day, it will be ourss again. I do not assk you to destroy it—only to ssstep asside when the time comess."**

### The Binding

If they accept (and they must, or remain stone):

> *Sythara's eyes blaze gold. You feel something cold coil around your heart—not painful, but present. A weight. A promise.*
>
> **"It iss done. Go now. Sstop the Unmaker'ss sservantss. And remember: I am watching. I am alwayss watching."**

She releases Yu'man as well, who looks shaken and chastened.

> **"You will guide them back to the ssurface. And you will tell your people: no more dealingss with the Black Sstar. Or I will come for them mysself."**

## Aftermath Notes

- The party now carries a curse they cannot speak about
- They are bound to eventually help the Syth'kari reclaim Southaven
- Yu'man may become a reluctant ally
- Sythara is aware of the Taelkor prophecy—she could be a future source of information
- The vow's implications are HUGE: Southaven's future is now tied to promises made in darkness
