## Overview

The Siege of Southaven is a multi-front crisis. The party can approach the situation in any order, but some locations are difficult to reach without first clearing obstacles:

- **Bandit Camps** and **Northern/Southern Blockades** prevent easy access to Southaven itself
- **Goblin War Camp** controls the eastern approach and farmlands
- **Blacktide Swamp** may be accessible but extremely dangerous
- **Southaven** itself is under lockdown by Lord Kael

Each location has its own tactical situation, NPCs, and rewards. The party's choices will affect the overall siege.

## Location: Northern Blockade

### Situation

The bandits have established a fortified checkpoint along the Tradeway north of Southaven. They're robbing and killing travelers, and turning away refugees. The blockade consists of makeshift walls, spiked barricades, and watchtowers overlooking the road.

### Key NPCs
- [[Rothgar Red-Hand]] (Bandit Captain) – A scarred veteran who believes in the cult's promises of power and wealth. He was hired by [[Blacksoul Silas]] and used to work under [[Donavar Reddmark]], before he was killed.
- 2-4 Bandits – Guards at each barricade, of which there are three - One on the main road and two on offshoots that lead to smaller roads to farm houses, etc.
- **1 Cultist Advisor** – Disguised as a merchant, coordinates with the cult
- **Yuan-ti Infiltrator (Optional)** – Discussing a plan moving forward with Rothgar, knows about the [[Blacktide Beastiary]]
- **Prisoners** – two Southaven refugees locked in cages: [[Gareth Voss]] and [[Harlan Drexel]], who the party should recognize from earlier. They were captured when this blockade was put up (about a week and a half ago, not too long after [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe|Bixby]] had left Southaven for [[Balandel]] to ask for aid).

### Objectives
- **Combat:** Break through or eliminate the blockade forces
- **Stealth:** Sneak past or infiltrate to sabotage their defenses
- **Diplomacy:** Convince bandits to abandon their post (difficult, requires evidence of cult betrayal or overwhelming force)
- **Rescue:** Free prisoners who may have valuable intelligence

### Tactical Elements
- **Barriers:** This part of the Tradeway has naturally high hedges on the eastern side of the road and the bandits have built a makeshift stone wall on the western side where they've set up their camps.
- **Horn of Warning:** If sounded, reinforcements arrive from nearby camps in 3-4 rounds. this horn is a magical item that allows only those who the blower wants (within 25 miles) to hear the horns sound. Non-magical barriers, distance, etc. do not make the horn sound any fainter to those who can hear it.
- **Barricades:** Spiked wooden walls provide cover but can be destroyed or bypassed

### Aftermath & Clues
If defeated or interrogated:
- Bandits reveal they're being paid in gold and "black crystals" by a cult leader operating from Blacktide Swamp
- A sealed letter for "Blacksoul S." mentions shipments of corpses being sent to the swamp

## Location: Southern Blockade

### Situation
Similar to the northern blockade but more chaotic. These bandits are less disciplined—some are deserters from Southaven's guard, others are opportunistic criminals. They're more interested in loot than ideology.

### Key NPCs
- **Marta "The Knife"** (Bandit Leader) – A former Southaven guard who turned to banditry a few years back. Bitter and pragmatic, not loyal to the cult. She used to date [[Gareth Voss]] (who now dates [[Lena Alwin]]) and is the one who got him into the [[Duskrunners]] when they were teenagers. She worked in 
- **3-5 Bandits** – A mix of thugs and deserters, low morale
- **1 Deserter Guard** – May recognize the party and could be convinced to help
- **Hostage** –Lena Alwin, Marta saw her outside the city walls one day and risked too much to capture her (out of anger from the past w/ Gareth), she lost two bandits but got Lena. Some of her bandits don't understand why she risked their lives for a "random" Southaven resident.

### Objectives
- **Combat:** Overrun the position
- **Negotiation:** Marta might be convinced to stand down if offered amnesty or proof that the cult betrayed them. She suspects they're being used and doesn't trust Rothgar's relationship with them. She'll also see an opportunity to take over the Duskrunners if Rothgar is gone.
- **Bribery:** Desperate and hungry, they might accept gold to abandon the blockade

### Tactical Elements
- **Barricades:** Hastily built barricades on the road.
- **Escape Route:** Bandits have horses tethered nearby for quick escape

### Aftermath & Clues
If the party negotiates:
- Marta may reveal that the cult promised them food but they haven't been seen in days, they are operating out of the Blacktide Swamp.
- An intercepted letter from the merchant reveals that a few Southaven's nobles (Elen and Vanessa Tywin) are secretly negotiating with someone (Edwin, a smuggler) to evacuate themselves. They are not evil, but self-serving nobles that are willing to work with anyone to protect themselves.
## Location: Fort Hellrock

### Situation
The main bandit encampment in the hills west of Southaven. These bandits are the core force supporting the blockades—better armed, better organized.

### Key NPCs
- **Varnek the Scarred** (Bandit Crime Lord). A somewhat recent convert but true believer in the Black Star. Has cult tattoos. Commands respect through fear. He was converted to the [[Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star]] two years ago and is the reason bandit guilds like the Duskrunners have been willing to work with them. He has a reputation for being a brutal crime lord and exercises his influence over many crime guilds, including the Duskrunners.
- **8-12 Bandits** – Spread throughout the camp
- **1 Cult Enforcers** – Death cultists who keep the bandits loyal through intimidation and dark magic
- **Yuan-ti Infiltrator (Optional)** – Disguised as a mercenary, has knowledge of the [[Blacktide Beastiary]]
- **Goblin Emissary** – A goblin negotiator coordinating raids with the bandits

### Objectives
- **Assault:** Attack one or multiple camps to weaken the siege
- **Sabotage:** Poison supplies, destroy weapons, or cause infighting
- **Assassination:** Eliminate Varnek to break bandit morale
- **Intelligence Gathering:** Learn about coordination between factions

### Tactical Elements
- **Secure Fort:** High wooden walls, secure front gate with towers. Two tiers. There is a broken wall being repaired around the back if the party finds it.
- **Caverns:** Can be entered via the stream or dropped down via the well.
- **Caged Beasts:** Wolves or bears kept hungry for guard duty or intimidation

### Aftermath & Clues
- Varnek's journal reveals his obsession with the [[Taelkor]] and the [[Order of the Black Star]].
- Evidence that someone high in Southaven (possibly guard captain level) is feeding information to the bandits

## Location: Goblin War Camp at Aramond's Lookout

### Situation
A massive goblin encampment at of Aramond's Lookout, a historic keep on the river (it was the keep that Aramond built when the kingdom of Solara first expanded into the valley) that was only lightly maintained. The goblins have destroyed and taken over the castle, and made a war camp around it. From the keep, they are well-positioned to raid the farmlands and prevent supply routes to Southaven. The goblins are organized under several tribes united by a powerful leader. Unlike typical goblins, these forces are disciplined and equipped with cultist-provided weapons.

### Key NPCs
- **Warchief Ghorzak the Red** (Hobgoblin Warlord) – Cunning military leader who made a pact with the cult for power
- **Zigra** (Goblin Hexer) – The hexer the party freed earlier! She's here but not happy about seeing them again. Her father, Chief Gralduk was killed when the party betrayed her. She hates them for doing what they did after she let them into the camp.
- **15-25 Goblins** – Mix of warriors, archers, and riders
- **3-4 Hobgoblins** – Elite guards and officers
- **1 Cult Overseer** – A death cultist "advising" the warchief
- **Yuan-ti Infiltrator (Optional)** – Acting as an advisor to the cult overseer, can reveal details about the [[Blacktide Beastiary]]

### Objectives
- **Diplomacy:** Negotiate with Zigra or Gralduk (if alive) to cause division
- **Assassination:** Eliminate the warchief or cult overseer to break command
- **Sabotage:** Destroy supplies, weapons, or the cult shrine binding the tribes
- **Information:** Learn what the cult promised the goblins
- **Escape:** This is probably too large to fight directly; tactical retreat after objectives

### Tactical Elements
- **Fortified Camp:** Palisade walls, watchtowers, multiple entrances
- **Wolf Riders:** Mobile units that patrol and can pursue fleeing enemies
- **Cult Shrine:** Dark altar where the cult overseer performs binding rituals
- **Supply Lines:** Stolen food from raids, vulnerable to fire or poisoning
- **Prisoner Cages:** Captured farmers and scouts, including children

### Aftermath & Clues
- Zigra (if contacted) reveals the cult promised the goblins "eternal glory in the Black Star's service"
- The warchief carries a dark crystal shard that pulses with necromantic energy
- Documents show the cult plans to sacrifice the goblins once Southaven falls
- Freed prisoners include a farmer who knows secret paths into Southaven

## Location: Blacktide Swamp - The Beastiary

### Situation
Deep in [[Blacktide Swamp]] lies [[Blacktide Beastiary]], an ancient ruin that has collapsed into a massive underground cavern. The cult has hired yuan-ti beast-masters to prepare three monstrous creatures for the assault on Southaven. The yuan-ti have tamed these beasts and keep them in separate chambers throughout the cave system, ready to unleash them when the time comes.

The yuan-ti are motivated by a promise from the cult: access to the ancient serpent temple rumored to lie beneath Southaven, along with payment in rare arcane components and sacrifices for their dark god.

### Key NPCs
- **Sseth'kara** (Yuan-ti Malison, Lead Beast-Master) – Cold and calculating, oversees the entire operation
- **2-3 Yuan-ti Purebloods** (Beast-Masters) – Each bonded to one of the three beasts
- **Yuan-ti Infiltrators** – Stationed at other siege locations (see notes below), can be interrogated to learn about the Beastiary

### The Three Beasts
1. **Venom Wing** – Young Black Dragon (reskinned: slimy, serpentine scales, can still fly)
2. **The Ravager** – Hydra (kept in the flooded sections of the cavern)
3. **The Coil** – Yuan-ti Abomination (massive serpent form, treated as the "alpha" beast)

### Objectives
- **Stop the Beast-Masters:** Defeat the yuan-ti before they can awaken all three beasts
- **Prevent Escape:** At least one beast will likely escape to attack Southaven—minimize the damage
- **Gather Intelligence:** Interrogate yuan-ti about cult plans and the temple beneath Southaven
- **Explore the Ruin:** The collapsed structure may hold clues about what lies beneath

### Tactical Elements
- **Collapsed Ruin Entrance:** Ancient stone archways descending into darkness
- **Multi-Chamber Cavern:** Three distinct areas connected by tunnels; yuan-ti will slither off in different directions to awaken beasts
- **Time Pressure:** Once combat begins, yuan-ti scatter to release beasts (party must choose which to pursue)
- **Hazardous Terrain:** Pools of stagnant water, slippery rocks, narrow passages
- **Beast Chambers:** Each chamber is designed to contain its specific beast—breaking containment is dangerous

### Combat Flow
1. Party encounters yuan-ti beast-masters
2. When threatened, yuan-ti split up and retreat to the three beast chambers
3. Party must decide which yuan-ti/beast to pursue first
4. Each chamber contains a different tactical challenge
5. At least one beast will likely be awakened and escape toward Southaven

### Yuan-ti Infiltrators (Other Locations)
Yuan-ti infiltrators can be found at one or more of the following locations. If interrogated, they can reveal the Beastiary's existence and the plan to unleash the beasts on Southaven:
- **Northern Blockade:** Disguised as a traveling merchant with the cultist advisor
- **Fort Hellrock:** Posing as a mercenary working with Varnek
- **Goblin War Camp:** Acting as an advisor to the cult overseer

### Aftermath & Clues
- Yuan-ti maps showing tunnels beneath Southaven leading to an ancient serpent temple
- Evidence of the cult's promise: arcane scrolls and dark artifacts meant as payment
- Beast-master journals detailing how long the creatures have been captive and their training
- If beasts escape: Southaven faces an additional monstrous threat during the siege

## Location: Southaven (Under Siege)

### Situation
The city is locked down by Lord Kael's order. The gates are closed, and guards prevent anyone from leaving. Food is running low, morale is collapsing, and rumors spread that Lord Kael has gone mad or is under dark influence. The party must enter covertly or with authority.

- **Velara Kael** – With the party, she'll be happy to see her family again
- **Brenlan Kael** – Trying to help resistance efforts secretly against his father's orders (who is trying to keep him safe)
- **Captain Harren Voss** (Guard Captain) – Either loyal to Kael or secretly helping citizens
- **Dr. Bixby Wizzlethorpe** – With the party, will be glad to be back as well
- **Edwin**: The smuggler
