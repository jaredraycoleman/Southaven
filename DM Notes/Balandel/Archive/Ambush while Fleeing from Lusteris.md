### Option A: Dwarf Ambush (En Route to Southaven)

**[As the dwarves step from the treeline, weapons raised]**

**Dwarf Commander (gruff):**  
"Drop your weapons. You're comin' with us."

**Dwarf Scout:**  
"Strange hooded figures in these woods—chantin', whisperin'. Cultists. Can't trust anyone."

**Dwarf Commander:**  
"Too many good folk dead. You camp here? You're suspects."

### Option B: Elf Ambush (En Route to Balandel)

**[Elves descend from the trees, bows drawn, blades ready]**

**Elven Warden (cold):**  
"Do not move. Surrender your arms."

**Elven Scout:**  
"Hooded figures walk these woods at night. The forest bleeds. You carry magic. That's enough."

**Elven Warden:**  
"You'll answer our questions. In custody."
