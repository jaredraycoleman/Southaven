> The campfire glows low beneath the starlit sky, the massive bones of a long-dead beast casting jagged shadows across the sand. The wind whistles through its ribcage like a dirge. The weight of what's been lost—and what lies ahead—presses in around you.  
> The silence breaks.

**Velara (arms wrapped around herself, staring into the fire):**  
“We need to get to Southaven. Now. If the goblins are on the move, if Silas is building something—my father needs to know. The city needs time to prepare.”

---

**Tilly (softly but with conviction):**  
“No. We need to go the other way—west, to Balandel. There's a great library there, older than the Emerald Hall. If we want to find Vel Seryn, and the truth about the ring and the shrine, that's where we'll find it.”

---

**Velara (looks over, skeptical):**  
“A library?”  
_(shakes her head)_  
“You think this will be solved in some dusty archive? While you search indexes, Southaven burns. And on the way, we can pass through Valenguarde Citadel. One of the relics is there—we _know_ that much.”

---

**Tilly (calm but pointed):**  
“And you think Silas doesn't know that too? If he's using the citadel as a stronghold, as your friends claim, then he already _has_ the crown. We'd be walking into his trap empty-handed.”

---

**Velara (icy, rising to her feet):**  
“And what, exactly, do we do instead? Wait? Hide in scrolls and pray for a revelation while cities fall like dominos? Is that what your scholars taught you? Caution while the world ends?”

---

**Tilly (steadily):**  
“No. They taught me to _understand_ before I act. To see the whole board before I move a piece. We've lost too much chasing shadows without knowing who casts them.”

---

**Velara (voice rising):**  
“We _acted_ because no one else would! While the Academy debated and nobles played politics, we were the ones fighting cultists and saving children.”

---

**Tilly (firm now, standing):**  
“And look where it got us. Ithilwen is dead. Leonard is gone. And we still don't know what this ‘Black Architect' is, or how to stop him. That crown, that ring, that shrine—they're part of a larger pattern. Balandel might help us see it.”

---

**[A long pause. The fire crackles, the desert wind picks up. Finn steps forward, voice low and calm.]**

**Finn:**  
“You're both right. Southaven is at risk. But so is everything else. We can't afford to fight blind again.”  
_(He looks around the circle.)_  
“If we move without knowing what we're up against... it won't just be Southaven we lose. It'll be the next city. And the next. Until there's nothing left to protect.”

---

*Velara crosses her arms again, eyes locked on the fire. Tilly closes her eyes for a breath. The wind moans through the bones above.*

**Tilly (quietly):**  
“I don't want to run from this fight. I want to _win_ it. But we need to know what we're holding... before we put it in someone's hands.”

---

**Finn (to the party):**  
“Time to choose.”
