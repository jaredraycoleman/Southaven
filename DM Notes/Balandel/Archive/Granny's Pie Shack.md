### **Read-Aloud Arrival Description**

> The trees thin into a luminous glade wrapped in soft mist and drifting pear blossoms. In the center, perched in the arms of an ancient willow, sits a crooked, cheerful treehouse. Painted signs and flowerpots dangle from its eaves, while enormous mushrooms cluster around its base like smiling children.
> 
> A narrow staircase spirals up to a round, wood-shingled door. A carved plank reads:  
> _“Grandma Louise's Healing Pies – Honest Sugar, Honest Magic.”_
> 
> Bees hum. Lanterns sway. And the air smells of stewed pears, cinnamon bark, and fresh soil.

### Grannie Louise – Description & Opening Dialogue

A plump woman in a faded apron and floral shawl. Her rosy cheeks and warm eyes radiate comfort, and her fingers are stained from jam and ink. Her voice is soft, syrupy, and oddly precise.

> “Well butter my biscuits—you're Bixby's friends, aren't you? I was wonderin' if you'd ever show up around here.”
> 
> “He sent out word to all us culinary conjurers in the Wandering Flame. Said you lot were doing something _important,_ bless your bones. And if we saw you, we were to lend a hand—or a pie. Speaking of...”
> 
> _(She pulls a pie from a hovering rack, steam curling from its golden crust.)_  
> “This one's pear custard with a walnut crumble. You'll eat, won't you?”

### **Roleplay Notes**

- Friendly, chatty, and quick to offer tea, slippers, and unsolicited advice.
- Her kitchen is impossibly tidy. Spices float. Pies rotate gently in midair.
- If asked about her magic, she proudly says:
    > “Bixby mixes cocktails, I blend bindings and brown sugar.”
- She's especially focused on **Lirielle**, watching her with strained politeness.
> “Ah, diviners. Always stirring the pot before it's ready. Can't just let things simmer.”

## **Secret Agenda (DM Info)**

Grandma Louise is **not truly evil**—but she is **deeply loyal** to a devilish pact and believes her duty is to remove those who **meddle in fate's flow**. She has sacrificed **seers and prophets** before, viewing it as a necessary act to “protect the recipe of the world.”

Her **hidden ritual chamber** lies beneath the **circular hearthstone** at the center of her round hut, concealed by an illusory shimmer and locked with a silent glyph. Inside:
- A **seven-pointed devil star**
- **Cages** (one occupied by a dazed elven seer)
- A **pearwood altar**
- And a **whispering oven** that smells faintly of blood and nutmeg

She sees **Lirielle's divination magic** as dangerously destabilizing—even if she doesn't fully understand the girl's role in larger events.

## **Legendary Actions (2/round)**

### **1. The Tia Sonia (Legendary Action)**

Louise produces a hot, glowing pie and magically flings it into a target's face—or telekinetically crams it into their mouth.

- **Target:** One creature within 30 ft
- **DC 15 Constitution Save**
- **On a fail:** The creature is **charmed** by Louise until the end of their next turn and cannot use reactions. On their next turn, their action is spent **"chewing"**—they do nothing but blissfully eat.
- **On a success:** The pie still tastes amazing. The creature gains **1d4 temp HP**, but is **distracted** (disadvantage on the next Wisdom save or check).

> “There now, doesn't that feel better? Just light my aunty always said, ‘Feed first, fight later.'”

### **2. Hearthroot Snare (Legendary Action)**

Louise claps her hands and whispers to the house itself. Roots and vines burst from the treehouse's wooden frame.
- **Area:** 15-ft radius around her
- Each creature of her choice in the area must succeed on a **DC 15 Strength save** or be **Restrained** by writhing vines of glowing bark.
- Restrained creatures may repeat the save at the end of their turns.

> “Now now, let's not stomp around like oxen in the pantry.”

## **Subtle Clues Before Combat**

- A _muffled voice_ beneath the hearth if players succeed on a DC 16 Perception check while she's cooking.
- Pears in her pantry show **withered faces** under the skin when cut open.
- Her goat has **glass eyes** and never blinks.
