The Vess family is a high noble family in [[Balandel]] (Lord [[Elarin Vess]] is a level-headed druid currently working as advisor to [[Archdruid Thalwen Myr]] at [[Telor'Augus, The Grove of Fire]]). The entire place was ransacked and the Vess family who lives there were all murdered horribly.

[[Velara Kael|Velara]] will be a prime suspect when she is found with a knife that has the same runes as were found in the demonic circle at the crime site. The actual murder was [[Dessie Pindlehop]], who was told by [[Serelion Thorneweave]], the imposter ambassador of [[Balandel Enclave]] to find a key to [[The Verdant Reliquary]] at the Vess Estate. Eleanor Vess (Elarin's mother) was murdered in the estate and tortured to reveal the location of the key.

### Mechanics

The players can visit [[Velara Kael|Velara]] at [[The Balandel Prison]], where she might give them some clues or guidance.

At the Estate, there are guards to keep people from coming in. The guards will want to see signed credentials that they are allowed to enter. The party can persuade, deceive, intimidate, etc. to get in, sneak in, etc.

Once in the estate, the party will see that the entire place was ransacked, and there are many clues that help the party discover that Dessie is the true murder. 

#### 1. Dining & Kitchen (Top-left, ground floor)

This is the most intact room in the house. It was likely avoided by the murderer.

- **Nature (DC 12):** Detects that many of the herbs and flowers in the greenhouse are not just culinary—they are **druidic warding plants**. Indicates the family was cautious.
- **Perception (DC 14):** A hidden cabinet holds **Elarin’s travel journal**, noting recent tension with Serelion Thorneweave and references to "sealing the grove."
- **Arcana (DC 15):** The spell components on the kitchen table are recent (less than 24 hours old) but not used for cooking. Likely ingredients for **illusion magic**.
#### 2. Bedrooms (Upper floor, left)

- **Arcana (DC 15):** Identical demonic runes seen in Duskwatch and Lusteris crypts are carved into the knife’s pommel. Detectable as having been **displaced magically** (teleported or conjured).
- **Insight (DC 14):** Anyone who knows Velara can tell she wouldn’t use such a blade—this points to a **setup**, not guilt.

#### 3. Ritual Room (Bottom-left corner building)

Scene of the most magical activity. Visible summoning circle (clearly from the second image).

- **Arcana (DC 12):** The circle was used within the last day. There's a residue of infernal energy and small handwriting in the glyphs if analyzed closely.
- **Religion (DC 14):** The demonic circle is a blood ritual of the [[Order of the Black Star]] that forces people to reveal secrets through unimaginable pain. Truth serum and serpent's venom are ingredients.
- **Detect Magic or Arcana (DC 15):** A **whispered voice** echoes faintly if the area is enchanted—“Find the key. End the roots.”

#### 4. Garden Drain / Center Courtyard

Open drain in the middle of the estate.

- **Survival (DC 12):** Scuff marks and tiny bloody footprints lead up to the drain from the ritual room. A 17 or higher reveals they are halfling-sized.
- **Investigation (DC 15):** The grate is ajar. If opened, it reveals scraps of torn parchment with a note mentioning that the queen has been visiting the verdant reliquary often as of late. "She has asked me to keep my key close."
- **Speak with Animals (Pigeons on Roof):** DC 10 Animal Handling or Persuasion. They saw “a little girl with curly hair” come and go twice, once carrying a glowing green vial.

### 5. Eleanor Vess’s Study (Right side, upstairs)

Accessible by stairs in the lower right building.

- **Investigation (DC 13):** The drawer is smashed open. The **key box** is broken and empty. A 17 or higher shows that dried tears on the chair indicate torture here.
- **Medicine (DC 14):** Blood on the chair and restraints suggest slow cuts, **information extraction**, not murder in passion.
- **Insight (DC 15):** Demonic scratches on the wall. This involved something supernatural.

#### 6. Storage Room (Bottom Right)
- There are three bandits looting the estate. They paid off two of the guards to let them in. They will try to talk their way out of it first, but attack if provoked. They can also be persuaded/intimidated to give a clue:
	- "The only thing that monster left alive here were the pigeons"
	- "There were child footprints in the blood, but Mrs. Vess has no small children"
### Loot
Of interest to loot, there are only a few items:
- Vess Family Heirloom: Ring of Animal Influence
- 1x Truth Serum and 2x Serpent Venom, in the kitchen
- Notes (see above)
