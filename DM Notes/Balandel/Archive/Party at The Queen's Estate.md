After saving the druid groves and the heart tree in the verdant reliquary, the Queen will invite the party to a celebration at her estate. [[Archdruid Thalwen Myr]] will crash the party, though, demanding answers about the ring of verdant stillness (she found out about the ring from torturing some of the attacking cultists). The situation can very easily slip into combat, though the party may be able to broker a truce. 

There are 14 Queensguard (Guard Captain) scattered throughout the the terrace in different rooms that will defend the Queen if combat ensues. Other NPCs (e.g., Talan Windfern, Elarin Vess, etc.) will take a side depending on the party's decision and their history with the party. The Archdruid is accompanied by 6 Druids of the Flame.

## Queen's Speech

The queen will start with a speech:

> “My friends, my champions of Southaven and beyond—  
> Tonight we stand in celebration, not of crowns or courts, but of life itself. Vel Enweir still breathes because of your courage. The Groves, sacred since the dawn of our people, yet flourish because you were willing to give of yourselves when others faltered.
> 
> I have walked long years with the burden of this realm upon my shoulders, and I know the price of peace often lies hidden, paid in shadows where few dare to look. Yet you—you have faced those shadows openly. You have brought light where corruption sought to root, and in so doing, you have preserved more than our beloved home. You have preserved hope.
> 
> The laughter of children in Balandel continues because of you. And though the road ahead is perilous, tonight let us lift our voices, and our cups, not in fear of what comes, but in gratitude for what has been saved.
> 
> May this night remind us that courage, like the groves themselves, can never be fully extinguished. It only waits for those brave enough to tend its flame. And tonight, you have proven yourselves the truest of tenders. To you, Heroes of Southaven, I give thanks.”

## The Archdruid's Interruption


> _The doors burst open, her staff striking the floor with a thunderous crack._
> 
> “Enough of this charade!
> 
> For centuries we wondered why Faeren's cycle faltered here—why death never fed life, why decay never gave way to renewal. We thought this land blessed. But no… it was chained. Chained by **you**, Aelra, and that wretched Ring of Verdant Stillness.
> 
> You have leeched the groves—Faeren's own sanctuaries—to feed your throne. You have bound sacred wildsong into a prison of stagnant beauty. That is not reverence. That is desecration!
> 
> You call yourself Queen, but I see no better than a necromancer, binding life and forest alike into your rotting eternity.”
> 
> _Gasps ripple through the hall as the druids of flame step forward, their eyes burning with fury._

**Queen Aelra (with scorn):**  

> “You call me a desecrator, Thalwen? I have seen the Unnamed One's shadow fall across this world—I bled to keep it from devouring us. You, for all your years, are still a child before true war. Do not lecture me on horrors you have never faced.”

**Archdruid Thalwen (furious):**  

> “Then hear me, Queen—if you will not surrender that cursed ring, we will tear it from your cold, dead fingers, and let Faeren's wrath finish what your arrogance began!”

### Blue Crystal Chandeliers

Some rooms are lit by chandeliers made of softly glowing blue crystals. If a crystal is shattered, it explodes in a burst of shards and energy.

- **Effect:** All creatures within 5 feet must make a **DC 17 Dexterity saving throw**.
    - On a failed save, a creature takes **1d6 piercing damage**.
    - On a successful save, it takes **half as much damage**.
### Emerald Gravity Crystals

The queen can activate a dormant green crystal as a **Free Action**. When activated, the crystal unleashes a pulse of gravitational energy, pulling all creatures within 15 feet toward its core.

#### Gravitational Pull

- At the **start of each creature's turn** while within 15 feet of an active crystal, that creature must make a **Strength (Athletics) saving throw** against the DC determined by its distance from the crystal (see table below).
- **On a success**, the creature resists the pull and may push itself **5 feet away from the crystal**, plus an additional **5 feet for every 5 points the saving throw exceeds the DC**.
    - _Example:_ A creature standing 5 feet from the crystal rolls a total of 21 against a DC of 17. The save succeeds by 4, so the creature may move 5 feet normally away from the crystal. (Had it rolled a 22, beating the DC by 5, it could move 10 feet away instead.)
- **On a failure**, the creature is pulled 5 feet closer to the crystal at the start of its turn and cannot willingly move farther away until it succeeds on the saving throw.

#### Crystalline Detonation (Queen's Turn)

On her turn, the queen can cause an active crystal to shatter in a burst of violent energy. Each creature within 15 feet of the crystal must make a **Dexterity saving throw**. On a failed save, a creature takes **XdY damage** (damage scaling by distance, if desired); on a success, they take half damage.

|Distance to Crystal|Strength Save DC|Detonation Damage*|
|---|---|---|
|0 ft. (inside)|20|8d8 force damage|
|5 ft.|17|6d8 force damage|
|10 ft.|15|4d8 force damage|
|15 ft.|12|2d8 force damage|
