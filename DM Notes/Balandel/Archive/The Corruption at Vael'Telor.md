> As you crest the final rise of tangled underbrush, the forest gives way to a glade choked with stagnant water and twisted roots. A thick, unnatural fog clings to the ground, barely disturbed by the sluggish flow of the swamp's surface.
> 
> The **smell hits you first**—sickly-sweet rot layered with the stench of wet bark and decaying flesh. You see them now: **a massive pile of treant corpses**, hollowed and sunken, their limbs twisted into unnatural shapes. They've been piled—intentionally—into a crude dam of roots and limbs. Flies swarm the surface. Black tendrils of mold creep over bark.

- One Shambling Mound comes out of the water to attack the party
- The party can investigate the site after combat and figure out where to go next (upstream to the Druid Grove)
### **Clue 1: Dead Druid with Sigil**

- **Location:** Half-buried under a root system beside the dam wall.
- **Investigation (DC 12):** Body shows signs of battle—puncture wounds from corrupted thorns.. Has a **leaf-etched wooden sigil** tucked in their hand, marked with the rune of **Faeren**.
- History (DC 17): A torn cloak bears the faded symbol of the **Circle of Verdant Flame**.
    - In a pouch: **a short, sealed note** (blood-stained but readable):
        > “If you find this, warn the others. They're coming down from the grove—something's twisting the heart-tree. We tried to stop it.”
### **Clue 2: Corruption Flow**

- **Location:** Water and soil near the shrine.
- **Nature or Survival (DC 13):**
    - Water here is thick with dark algae and smells foul—**unnatural concentration of decay**.
    - Trails of corrupted plant growth lead **upstream**, not outward—this place is where the blight settles, not where it originates.
    - Small fungal tendrils pulse with a faint rhythm—**like something is draining life from upstream**.
### **Clue 3: Trapped Squirrel**

- **Location:** Caught in a tangle of creeping vines.
- **Perception (DC 12) or Passive Perception 13+** notices it squeaking in distress.
- **Speak with Animals:**
    - The squirrel frantically describes “the tall bark-friends dying,” and “glowing roots, bad water, no birds anymore.”
    - If pressed:
        > “The water got bad _there_—the stone-place under the white falls. The noise-things came, and the air got dark. They made the forest quiet.”
## **Loot from the Dead Druid**
- **Studded Leather Armor of Quiet Root**
	- This armor is reinforced with bark and root fibers.
    - Grants advantage on checks to avoid being tracked in forests or swamps.
- **Pouch with 18 gp, 1 healing potion, and a carved wooden totem (focus for druidic magic).**
