> You're escorted through granite halls lit by molten sconces and veined with gold and red crystal. As the great doors swing open, the scent of forge smoke and spiced ale fills the air.
> 
> At the far end of a vaulted chamber sits **King Brundrik Stonebluff**, a broad-shouldered dwarf with a braided beard the color of ash and flame. He wears a crown of black iron, and his throne is carved from a single block of redstone. He rises to greet you—not with formality, but with the solid cheer of a warrior-king.

### **Opening Dialogue – Brundrik Welcomes the Party**

**King Brundrik (booming, warm):**  
“Ah! So you're the ones making all the noise in the world above. Sit! Drink! There's roasted goat and fresh barleybeer—I'm not lettin' you face down a kingdom's woes on an empty stomach.”

> _(Servants appear with mugs, and guards stand at ease. You're ushered to carved seats near a massive hearth.)_

**King Brundrik (serious now):**  
“You'll have quarters fit for a thane tonight, and no doors barred to you—save my treasury and my daughter's room.”  
_(He chuckles—then sighs.)_  
“But don't let the beer fool you. There's rot in the stone.”

### **Quest Setup – The King's Worry**

**King Brundrik (grim, quieter):**  
“The goblins are gettin' bold. Too bold. They used to skulk in tunnels, raid a caravan here and there. Now they're striking supply lines. Outposts. Mining shafts.”  
_(He takes a long drink.)_  
“We've lost three tunnels this month—_collapsed_ with no cause. Good dwarves buried, and no sign of goblin powder or sabotage.”

> _(He leans forward, all trace of cheer gone.)_

**King Brundrik:**  
“I need you to go down there. Into the lower mines. Find out what's really goin' on. If there's corruption, if there's somethin' worse than goblins—we need to know before the stone turns against us.”

### **Departure Hook**

> As the fire crackles, the king clasps each of you by the forearm.

**King Brundrik:**  
“You've got the run of the hold—so long as you show respect. Rest tonight. Eat well. Tomorrow... the Deepways open.”

Would you like clues and encounter options for what they find in the mines (e.g., warped goblins, underground rift, a Black Star cult totem weakening the stone)? I can build out that next scenario to match.
