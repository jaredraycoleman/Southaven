You are escorted through moonlit glades and hanging bridges of woven silverwood. The deeper you go, the quieter the forest becomes—until even your footsteps feel unwelcome. Finally, you're brought into a vast clearing beneath a tree so large it seems to scrape the sky.

Lantern-light glows like starlight among its branches. Elven sentinels stand silent as statues. At the base of the tree is a throne carved from living wood, curved and elegant as if grown for its occupant. Upon it sits **Queen Sylanthiel of Vel Enweir**, cloaked in layers of shadow-green silk and silver thread. Her crown is a circlet of woven branches and starlight. Her gaze is piercing.


### **Opening Dialogue – The Elf Queen Speaks**

> Her voice is soft, but it carries with unnatural clarity.

**Queen Sylanthiel (measured, cold):**  
“You arrive in my forest under suspicion, in days choked with omens... and claim you mean no harm.”

> _(She scans each of you in turn.)_

**Queen Sylanthiel:**  
“The last ones who walked cloaked through our woods spoke in riddles and prayers—to _things_ that do not belong here. Now the roots rot, and the rivers taste of blood.”

**Queen Sylanthiel (leaning forward):**  
“Why should I not believe you're the same?”

> _(Pause for player responses.)_

### **Quest Offer – Testing the Party**

> After a moment, she leans back—eyes narrowing, thoughtful.

**Queen Sylanthiel:**  
“If your intentions are pure, then prove it. To the east lies a glen called Vael'telor. The trees there have blackened. The spirits have gone silent. We sent scouts—none returned.”

> _(A long pause.)_

**Queen Sylanthiel (coldly):**  
“Go. Cleanse the rot. Or do not return at all.”

> _(She raises a hand, and the guards step back slightly.)_

**Queen Sylanthiel:**  
“If you carry the weight of prophecy, then let the forest judge you.”

### Scene: The Audience Chamber Beneath the Tree of Stars

> Queen Sylanthiel rises from her throne. As she steps forward, the air bends with her movement—like moonlight over water. Her presence is overwhelming, regal and cold as the high canopy.
> 
> She extends one hand, palm up.

**Queen Sylanthiel (ceremonial, firm):**  
“Swear it. By root and river, star and stone. Swear that you will cleanse Vael'telor and do no harm to this wood.”

> _(As the party agrees or nods, her eyes begin to glow faintly—a silver radiance threading through the branches above.)_

> You feel something slide over your skin—like mist turning solid for just a moment, sinking into your bones.

**Queen Sylanthiel:**  
“The vow is sealed. The forest itself will know if you break it.”

### **Hospitality with Conditions**

> The Queen returns to her throne, her voice softening—but no warmer.

**Queen Sylanthiel:**  
“You may rest in the The Scarlet Shield Tavern in the city outskirts. It is the only inn open to outsiders.”

> _(She lifts her gaze, eyes narrowing slightly.)_  
> “You are not to wander the city. You will remain in your rooms unless escorted. This is not a punishment—it is protection. For us… and for you.”

**Queen Sylanthiel (final):**  
“Complete this task, and we may speak again. Refuse, or flee—and the forest will close around you.”

### **Scene Close – Escort and Departure**

> As you are led from the court, you pass under silver lanterns swinging in still air. The hush returns. It is not peace—it is the weight of being _watched._
