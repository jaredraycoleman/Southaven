### Background 

[[Garrin Dace]] asked the party to find [[Alith Vaelrin]] who was missing. He was killed by cultists who are using his family [[Crypt of House Vaelrin|crypt]] as a base of operations. At the crypt, the revenant [[Melissa Vaelrin]], Alith's sister was awoken. She seeks revenge from her "killer", Alith, who was indirectly responsible for the fire that killed the entire Vaelrin family. 
### Setup

> As you relax at the Scarlet Shield Tavern, a sudden slam echoes through the building—the doors snap shut, locking themselves with a metallic click. A heartbeat later, all the candles gutter out in unison. Panic ripples through the crowd. Someone rushes for the door and yanks at it, but it won't budge.
> 
> Then the air goes still.
> 
> A voice fills everyone's head—cold, female, and full of restrained fury:
> 
> "Only one needs to die. Make him come outside."

People begin shouting, some cry, a few pound on the walls. It's eerily quiet outside. Everyone can still speak, but there's a feeling of being watched.

### Haunting Mechanics

- Going Outside: 4d10 force/slashing damage (commoners die instantly).
- Every 2–3 minutes, one NPC is dragged away by unseen force if no progress is made.
- After 2 deaths, Garrin confesses.

### Garrin's Behavior and Dialogue

Before confession, given they've figured out her identity.

> "I don't know why she's doing this. She must be confused…"

After Two Deaths (Breaks Down):

> (Voice cracking) 
> "It was my fault. I—I brought fireworks to the wedding. Dumb prank, I thought it'd be funny. Melissa saw me hiding them in the kitchen. I smiled and shushed her. She didn't tell anyone…"
> 
> (Tears now) 
> "I didn't mean for the fire… gods, I didn't know they were that unstable. I never thought—poor Alith, poor Melissa, her whole family…"
> 
> (Looks toward the door) 
> "If she needs me to pay for it, maybe that's fair. I just… hope it's quick. "
