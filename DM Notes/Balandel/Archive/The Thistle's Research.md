### Vel Seryn Is in the Dragonspire Mountains

**Finn (pulling a leather-bound tome from his satchel):**  
_"After cross-referencing what little remains from pre-Solaran records with trade-route sketches in the old waystones, I'm convinced: Vel Seryn was situated somewhere in the Dragonspire range. Three separate accounts mention 'stone towers above the smoke-veiled gulfs'—that matches no other known peaks."_

**Tilly (half-listening, sketching the peaks):**  
_"It makes sense. A city hidden in mountains—forgotten by time."_

### Information on the First Shrine

**Finn (carefully flipping through an old scroll):**  
_"There's no question now—the First Shrine is real, and still in use. It's considered the most sacred site in the Church of Elandria, and according to these records, it lies somewhere beneath the palace in Solaris. The location itself is a closely guarded secret, known only to the high priestesses."_

**Tilly (gently):**  
_"I've heard pilgrims speak of it like it's a place you dream of, not one you find. If it's really hidden under the palace, it must be older than the city around it."_

**Finn:**  
_"It likely is. And from what I found, it's not just a shrine—it's a place of attunement, a kind of spiritual anchor. The Hammer's design matches a symbol etched into the oldest version of Solara's sunburst—back before the modern church restructured its doctrine. This shrine may be one of the last places where the original rites were still performed."_

**Tilly:**  
_"So the answers we're looking for might already be in plain sight—just hidden under a few layers of history, politics, and marble."_

### Three Possible Locations for Vel Seryn

**Tilly (unrolling a map):**  
_"After piecing together the few surviving fragments, I've narrowed Vel Seryn's location to one of three sites in the Dragonspires:"_

- **Thar'Hemeth's Step:**  
    _"A nearly forgotten mountain pass lined with collapsed statues. Locals claim it's haunted by voices that whisper in the snow."_
    
- **The Hollow of Stars:**  
    _"A crater valley where the stars are said to shine even at noon. Some records call it a 'celestial conduit.'"_
    
- **The Blackridge Vaults:**  
    _"Beneath an abandoned dwarven mining operation. No one goes there now—miners reported seeing cities in their dreams, and not all of them woke up."_

**Finn:**  
_"They all sound like truly terrible places to go, so of course it's one of them."_

### Khasim's Crown (Crown of Judgement Origin)

**Finn (looking up from a thick leather folio):**  
_"I've found a bit more information on that crown of yours, Momeline. Its origin traces back to a place called "Khasim's Crown"—once the capital of a desert empire. The high magisters forged many of the relics used in the first war."_

**Tilly (quietly):**  
_"They say no wind ever moves through Khasim's ruins. Like even the air remembers what happened there."_

**Finn (more cautiously):**  
_"The Crown of Judgement was one of their final creations. Likely forged in secret, it wasn't meant to be worn by just anyone. Everything I've found points to this: someone with a natural connection to fate is required to awaken it. Not just to wear it, but to truly attune to its purpose."_

### The Ring of Verdant Stillness _(revealed after the Queen's confession)_

**Tilly (after long silence):**  
_"I found references to a ‘Verdant Ring' in the Wild Accord archives. It was created by druidic highbinders during the First War as a temporary measure—to stabilize nature after the Architect's defilement. But the notes make one thing very clear: it was never meant to last more than a generation."_

### The Wild Spark Prophecy

**Finn (reading from a scroll):**  
_"There are three versions. One's written like scripture, one like a song, one like a blacksmith's oath. But they all share the same bones: fire will rise, wild and divine, against the dark."_

> _"Hammer, Ring, and Crown will stand at her side—  
> The last relics of an ancient, unending battle."_

**Tilly (murmuring the hearthsong):**  
_"‘A hammer rings where frost once clung… A crown of flowers, soft and pale.' That's what my gran used to sing before spring. I always thought it was just about planting potatoes."_

**Finn (genuinely shaken):**  
_"This isn't just myth. This is pattern. Whoever 'she' is—the Wild Spark—the relics are waking up to meet her. And the Black Star is moving too."_
