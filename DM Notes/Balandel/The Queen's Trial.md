[[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]] has been accused of [[Archdruid Thalwen Myr]] of using "necromantic" magic to sustain [[Vel Enweir]] in eternal beauty by draining the druid groves [[Shael'Nareth, The Grove of Twilight]], [[Telor'Augus, The Grove of Fire]], and [[Myrlen'Thal, The Grove of Morning]]. The Archdruid attacked, but [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] convinced her to stop and instead hold a trial.

After the party saved the groves, [[Archdruid Thalwen Myr]] promised to interrogate a cultist leader ([[Malrec]]) she had captured and find out the reason for the attack. Through brutal, fiery torture, she extracted the location of the cultist's nearby operating center. After raiding the center, she found a few notes of interest:
- A note from *Myhran*, the cultist running operations in Balandel from the [[Crypt of House Vaelrin]] that the party killed. The note says everything is going well, but that the ring does *not* exist and to stand down for now. The note is the one the party modified in [[Session 17 - Echoes Beneath the Crypt]].
- A scrambled note from [[Lyrian Brightwind|Lyrian]] to [[Velara Kael|Velara]] that has not been decrypted yet. 

> Ihrr ygw fmjcgrk. Lbrj pw ulrx. Wbbe Adas. V ent u Ixdprn.

which translates, with the keyword "pants" to:

> They grw strnger. Tmrw we flee. Embr Hlls. I lve u Velara.

- A note from [[Serelion Thorneweave]] to [[Malrec]]:

> Malrec,
> 
> The Ring of Verdant Stillness is real. I cannot fathom why Myrhan told you otherwise, but your doubts are wasted time. We cannot hope to take Balandel while the Queen wears it. Accelerate your work at the groves—break them, and her strength will falter. You are to launch a full assault on the penultimate day of July.
> 
> The heroes complicate matters. They struck down Myrhan, yet his death may serve us—he was careless. Already, the boy he trained shows dangerous promise. To raise his sister and her lover with scarcely a month's discipline… volatile, yes, but perhaps the storm we require. I will keep him close.
> 
> The witch is gone, another victim of these meddling heroes. Inconvenient, but not crippling. Far more troubling is the rescue of the Sylvenblade child. She is Balandel-born and dreams true. She must be eliminated. This will be a good test for the boy.
> 
> —Serelion


## NPC Involvement

Both the Archdruid and the Queen will try to get the party on their side. Other characters that could be convinced to testify, provide evidence, etc. are:

[[Talan Windfern]]: Wrongly accused of being involved in the cultist plans by the party (they think he is the "boy" that the cultists in the cave behind the prison were referring to but it is actually [[Jesse Durn]]), he may reveal information about what he went through, the party's activity, etc.

[[Tilly Thistle|Tilly]] and [[Finnathan Thistle|Finn]] Thistle: They may be interrogated on what they're doing in Balandel, their relationship with the party, the party's activities, future plans, etc. Their default will be to tell the truth.

[[Velara Kael]]: Will also be interrogated on the party. She doesn't like the Queen very much (after being falsely accused of killing her high adviser), and leans toward taking the druid's side. She will do whatever the party asks her to, though.

[[Garrin Dace]] may be interrogated about the party's activities. He owes them, though, for saving him against the revenant [[Melissa Vaelrin]]. News has spread about his being responsible for the killing of the Vaelrin's, though, and he is hated throughout Balandel.

[[Céline Aravel]], [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe|Bixby]], and the rest of the Shopping district NPCs may be interrogated as well.

[[Calenhir Sylvenblade]]'s daughter [[Laerwen Sylvenblade]] is mentioned in the note as an assassination target. The Archdruid is trying to keep this secret. She has assigned two druids of the flame to monitor the Sylvenblade's home. She hopes to use this to draw them out.

[[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]] will try to get the party on her side. She is confined to her estate, but offers one of the twin orbs of passage to the party to maintain a communication channel. She tells them that moving it makes it become unstable to use all the time, so they will need to be careful (see mechanics of orbs). She will try to convince the party that the secret of the ring must be kept for the protection of the realm. She argues that, without it, [[Vel Enweir]] and the rest of the Elfwood will fall to the [[Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star]]. She asks the party to assassinate [[Malrec]], destroy the evidence in the [[Balandel Courthouse]], and get key NPCs on her side. She may even ask the party to deal with some other NPCs violently if they seem like they are taking the Archdruid's side. Before the hearing, she will give them her key to the verdant reliquary and ask them to hide it and the Twin Orb of Passage in the reliquary.

Judge [[Caelthas Sunstrider]] is a level-headed judge of the church of [[Elandria]]. He will try to maintain order and is very concerned about the case involving the Queen, who founded [[Vel Enweir]] and has ruled for four thousand years. 

[[Irielle Duskwhisper]] was a member of the [[Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star]] but promised to change. [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]] allowed her to live if she went to the nunnery at the church of [[Elandria]] and promised to devote herself to her. Irielle knows the codeword "pants" that the party used to decrypt Lyrian's note.

[[Elarin Vess]] is torn between his grove (he trained under the Archdruid at the Grove of Fire) and his mother, who was the Queen's highest adviser and closest friend. He will also serve as the juror for the Grove of Fire, and will be the only juror that the party will have met before.

## The Archdruid's Plan

The archdruid will visit NPCs in this order to gather evidence. Every time the players visit someone, so does the archdruid. Whoever gets to people first might make a difference.

1. [[Garrin Dace]] and [[Serelion Vael]] at the [[Scarlet Shield Tavern]]
2. [[Elarin Vess]], who may reveal the hidden questioning chamber where [[Talan Windfern]] is being held
3. [[Talan Windfern]]
4. [[Irielle Duskwhisper]]
5. [[Finnathan Thistle|Finn]], [[Tilly Thistle|Tilly]], and [[Velara Kael|Velara]]
6. [[Calenhir Sylvenblade]]

## Day of the Hearing

> The **streets outside the courthouse** are choked with people—elves in traveling cloaks, merchants with half-shuttered stalls, even woodcutters from the outer villages. They press shoulder-to-shoulder, buzzing with rumor and speculation. Some cheer when you pass; others jeer, voices sharp with fear or anger. 
> 
> Inside, the **great hall of judgment** is already crowded. Benches line both sides of the chamber, overflowing with citizens craning to see. The vaulted ceiling rises high, its carved beams etched with scenes of druidic renewal, but the air feels close, heavy with incense and expectation.
> 
> At the **front row**, you spot familiar faces—**Tilly, Finn, and Velara**—waiting tensely, whispering among themselves as you enter.
> 
> The **Queen of Balandel** sits upon a low, carved seat at the front of the hall. Her posture is rigid, proud, though her fingers twitch slightly against her gown. Beside her, upon a pedestal, rests what looks at first like an ornament—**a smooth silvery white sphere**, glimmering faintly in the filtered light. To most, it seems a mere decoration. But to you, it is unmistakable: **the other Twin Orb of Passage**.
> 
> The **jury benches** are only half-filled, six druids robed in shades of forest and flame sitting with solemn expressions, waiting to be swayed. At the center, **Judge Caelthas Sunstrider** presides in his white-and-gold vestments, a silver scale emblem of Elandria hanging at his chest. His eyes flicker across the chamber, measuring not just the Queen but all who have come to watch.
> 
> A hush ripples through the hall as you step forward, the last arrivals before the trial begins.
### Trial Mechanics

#### Structure

1. **Opening Statements** – Each side (Archdruid & Queen) gives a short speech. Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation checks may set the tone with the jury (minor bonuses/penalties).
2. **Witness Phase** – 3 rounds. Each round, both prosecution and defense may:
    - Call or cross-examine a witness (NPC or PC).
    - Present evidence (letters, artifacts, testimony).
    - The opposing side gets a rebuttal.
3. **Closing Arguments** – Each side makes one last push to sway the jury.

#### Jury Sympathies

- Each juror starts with a **neutral sympathy score (0)**, except where strong bias exists (e.g., Fire Grove leader might lean toward druids).
- Sympathies range from **-10 (Archdruid)** to **+10 (Queen)**.
- At the end, each juror "votes" based on their score (≤ -3 = guilty, ≥ +3 = innocent, middle = undecided).

#### Skill Checks

- **Base DC 15 persuasion/deception/intimidation** to sway a juror with testimony.
- Juror modifiers
    - +2 if testimony aligns with their values (e.g., druids care about nature cycles).
    - -2 if testimony offends them or contradicts known facts.
- Evidence: presenting a key document or artifact gives **advantage** or an auto-shift of 1d4 sympathy points.

#### Sympathy Shifts

- **Critical Success (nat 20)**: +2d4 sympathy shift.
- **Success**: +1d4 shift.
- **Failure**: -1d4 shift.
- **Critical Failure (nat 1)**: -2d4 shift and disadvantage on next attempt with that juror.

#### Secret Factors

- If the party reaches a juror before the Archdruid, they get **advantage on the first interaction** with them.
- Hidden biases (revealed with Insight DC 15–20):
    - Some jurors dislike the Queen personally.
    - Some fear the forest collapsing if the ring is destroyed.

#### Outcome

- Majority of jury decides.
- **If hung jury (3 vs. 3 or indecisive)** → Judge Caelthas Sunstrider casts the deciding vote, favoring **justice over politics** (leaning toward whichever side made the most credible case).
- If the Queen wins, cultists hiding in the rafters (including [[Jesse Durn]] will attack and try to assassinate the Queen).
- If the Archdruid wins, the Queen will touch the Twin Orb of Displacement and disappear. The druids will attack and the Archdruid will be enraged, declaring marshal law and try to take over the city.

### Opening Statement - Archdruid Thalwen Myr

> The Archdruid rises slowly, the sound of her staff striking the marble floor echoing once—twice—before the hall falls silent.
> 
> "For four millennia, Queen Aelra Sylanthiel has ruled Vel Enweir. In that time, empires have turned to dust, rivers have carved new paths, and the forest has healed itself a thousand times over. Yet one thing has remained unchanged—**Her Majesty’s face.**
> 
> The land withers, yet the Queen blooms eternal. And that, my kin, is no miracle of nature or blessing from Faeren, as we have been told it is. It is theft.
> 
> I accuse Aelra Sylanthiel of **desecrating the cycle of life itself**, of draining the sacred groves—**Shael'Nareth**, **Telor'Augus**, and **Myrlen'Thal**—to fuel her unending youth and sustain Vel Enweir in a false, brittle beauty. I accuse her of wielding **necromantic power** beneath the guise of preservation, and of using the _Ring of Verdant Stillness_—an artifact that halts all change, and with it, all life.
> 
> These groves, the lungs of our realm, were left barren and gasping. Their roots bled dry, their spirits silenced.
> 
> I did not come to this judgment lightly. I have stood beside this Queen through famine and flame. I have seen her wisdom and her cruelty both. But when I found the fires of Telor’Augus guttering, when the trees of Shael’Nareth whispered their dying prayers in the ash, I knew mercy without truth is only cowardice.
> 
> You will hear of the evidence we gathered—the letters of the cult that served her ends, the confessions of a captured cultist, and the writings of a Black Star leader disguised as Serelion Thorneweave, declaring that the Queen’s strength was drawn from our ruin. You will hear of her lies, her silences, her quiet orders that ensured those who knew too much did not live to speak.
> 
> I do not seek her death by my own hands. I seek her _return to the cycle_. Let her relinquish the Ring. Let her face the rot she has sown and the night she has delayed too long.
> 
> **For if the roots are poisoned, the forest cannot heal.**
> 
> And if we, the Circle of Verdant Flame, do nothing—then we become her accomplices in the slow murder of our world."

## Places of Interest

### The Courtroom

The **courtroom of Balandel** is a vaulted hall of pale stone and carved oak beams, its walls etched with scenes of justice, growth, and renewal. By day it is bright with sun filtered through tall, stained-glass windows depicting the goddess Elandria's sunburst, though the air is heavy with incense and whispers.

- **The Evidence Room**: A narrow, windowless chamber lined with locked oak cabinets, guarded at all times by two clerks. Inside are scrolls, letters, and artifacts submitted for review—including Serelion's *note* about the Ring of Verdant Stillness. Dusty shelves carry decades of mundane records, but the current trial evidence is sealed in a chest marked with the Judge's sigil. The Queen privately urges the party to destroy these incriminating items.
- **The Holding Room**: Bare and cold, this stone cell is where witnesses or accused parties wait under guard until called to speak. Iron rings are set into the walls for chains if necessary. The air here smells faintly of mildew and old sweat.
- **The Trial Room**: The central chamber where proceedings unfold. Chairs for the jury of twelve druids sit on the eastern wall, while the Archdruid sits in the prosecutor's bench. The Queen sits to one side of the dais beneath Judge [[Caelthas Sunstrider]], her orb of passage innocuously placed on a pedestal beside her. The ceiling rises high into shadowed rafters where cultists lurk, waiting to strike if the Queen appears likely to walk free.
- **Judges' Quarters**: A private, oak-paneled room adjoining the chamber, filled with Caelthas' personal books on law and theology. A silver sunburst holy symbol rests here, enchanted to cast _Zone of Truth_ once per day. Under the desk, there is a small locked chest (DC 24 sleight of hand to lockpick). The key to the chest is hidden in the balance on his desk:

> Resting in the center of the desk is a ceremonial brass balance scale, polished to a dignified shine. Its upright column is crafted with unusual care
> 
> Arranged neatly nearby are four carved figurines of saints, each small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. One depicts a kind-faced figure with an open hand extended in welcome. Another is a robed scholar holding a book and a mirror. A third shows a solemn judge clutching a scroll, his gavel resting at his side. The last is a torchbearer, her flame-crowned form catching the light with an uncanny glimmer.

If they look around more:

> Among the saints are a few scraps of parchment and notes. One bears the line: "_I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness_, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.". Another note says: "Four voices speak, yet only two are heard; the others wait in silence."

**Puzzle Solution**: Put the Empathy figurine on one side truth on the other.

- Hidden among the papers is a sealed letter from [[Serelion Vael]], owner of the [[Scarlet Shield Tavern]], written in intimate terms that could hint at an improper relationship—a detail that might be twisted into blackmail against the judge if revealed.

> Cael,
> 
> I remember our last night at the Shield, when for a while you let the weight fall from your shoulders. Hold on to that part of yourself in the days ahead. If you wish to speak again when this is over, you know where to find me.
> 
> —Ser

- **Meeting Room (Second Floor)**: A simple chamber with a wide oak table, used for private counsel between druids or clerics during recesses. Scattered among the Archdruid's satchels are rough notes of her interrogation plan—names of witnesses she has/intends to pressure, hints of leverage she intends to use, and her uncompromising stance toward the Queen.

> Visit Scarlet Shield — Queen's allies gather there. Push Garrin & Serelion.
> Test Elarin's loyalty. He wavers.
> "Talan"? Who is this boy really? Must know.
> Irielle — at the nunnery now. She may be the key.
> Press the Thistles & Velara — they'll crack under weight.
> Seer girl (Laerwen) — keep watch. Too dangerous to ignore.

- **Spectating Benches (Second Floor)**: A gallery balcony overlooking the trial floor, packed with citizens craning for a view. Murmurs rise and fall like surf, their shifting mood reflecting every success or stumble in the arguments below.
- **The Rafters**: Dark wooden beams crisscross the ceiling far above, accessible only by concealed ladders in the walls. Shadows hide a handful of cloaked cultists who wait with poisoned crossbows and daggers, prepared to intervene the moment the Queen's innocence seems assured.

### Fire Druid Camp

Outside the city walls, the **druids of the flame** keep a temporary encampment among charred stones and fire-scorched banners. Six druids maintain constant flame-braziers, their orange light a beacon at night. They regard outsiders with wary suspicion, for they revere cleansing fire as both a purifier and a judge.

At the edge of the camp, **Malrec**—the cultist captured by the Archdruid—is bound to a tree, gagged and burned from interrogations. Druids keep him alive, though barely, so that further questions may be extracted. His groans carry faintly through the trees.

**Fire Runes:** Hidden runes scribed in ash around the camp perimeter. Crossing without permission (Arcana DC 16 to spot) triggers radiant fire for 2d6 damage and marks the intruder in glowing flame for 1 hour (advantage on attacks against them).

**Living Flame Elementals:** At night, two druids ritually awaken small flame elementals that patrol the edges of the camp. They appear as floating motes of ember-eyes in the dark and screech like kettles when startled.

**Large Fire Elemental:** If the players are caught, a druid of the flame can, as their action, throw a special dust into the campfire to summon a large Fire Elemental under its control.

### The Prison

The **city prison** is an austere building of black stone, its corridors damp with dripping water from the riverbed beneath. Torches sputter in iron brackets, casting long shadows along the barred cells.

Among the prisoners are **captured cultists**, chained and bruised, awaiting trial or execution. The Queen has quietly asked the party to see them dead before they can speak—an act she insists will prevent further unrest. Guards here are weary but dutiful, and a bribe or distraction might loosen their vigilance.

### The Queen's Estate

The **royal estate of Queen Aelra Sylanthiel** lies within walled gardens thick with ancient ivy and silverleaf trees. In the week before the trial, she is confined here under watchful eyes, her every movement monitored by loyal attendants and suspicious druids alike.

Within the halls, pale stone corridors lead to airy rooms hung with tapestries of Vel Enweir's glory. The Queen spends her days in seclusion, meeting only with her closest retainers. The Twin Orb of Passage rests on a pedestal in her private chambers, its faint green light casting long shadows across the walls.

Though guarded, the estate retains an air of quiet melancholy, as if its mistress knows she may never walk free again.

### St. Andral's Church

[[Saint Andral's Church]] is a small church a on the outskirts of Balandel. This is where [[Irielle Duskwhisper]] has gone to work, helping the priest maintain the church. 

> "Ah—praise the Light! A paladin of Elandria, here, in my little chapel… I had begun to wonder if Her knights had forgotten us."
> 
> (pauses, then with quiet humility)  
> "Forgive me, I don't mean to burden you so soon, but St. Andral's is in poor shape these days. The roof leaks when it rains, and the walls… well, you can see the cracks for yourself. If you would be so kind, I know you paladin's pay a monthly tithe to the church and... well do you think it would be possible for you to dedicate yours to our humble chapel this time?
> 
> (voice drops, heavier)  
> "Feeding the hungry has grown costly of late. Grain and root-vegetables have nearly doubled in price at the markets. The farmers on the outskirts whisper of blight and rot spreading in their fields. Some say it's natural. I... don't know. Farmer Elandel up the road seems to think it's something more nefarious.

#### The Crimson Watch

> The **oak doors of St. Andral’s creak open**, letting in a shaft of late-afternoon light. Four figures step inside: crimson-dyed leather armor, scarred faces, and hands resting a little too casually on the hilts of short swords. One man pushes forward—a broad human with a shaved head and a crimson sash word across his chest like a badge of office.

**DC 15 Perception Check**:
> The villagers gathered in the pews fall silent. The priest stiffens, his knuckles whitening on his staff.

**Daren Hollowmark (smirking, voice low and mocking):**  
> “Afternoon, Father. Time again. You’ve had a whole month to scrape together the fee. Let’s not pretend you’ve forgotten.”

He clinks a heavy purse against his palm, eyes sliding over to the party.

> “And what’s this? New friends of yours? Don’t look like farmers. What’s your business here?”

|**Check**|**DC**|**What’s Noticed**|
|---|---|---|
|**Insight (12)**|12|The captain’s swagger is calculated; he’s testing how far he can push without real resistance. He doesn’t actually want a fight inside the church.|
|**Insight (16)**|16|Beneath the bravado, his men are nervous—more scared of their captain than loyal to him.|
|**Perception (13)**|13|Spot a bloodstain half-washed from one man’s sleeve. They’ve “collected” recently.|
|**Perception (17)**|17|Notice that one of the watchmen is keeping his eyes on the side door—an escape route in case things go bad.|
|**History (12)**|12|Recall rumors of the Crimson Watch—villagers say they’re former mercenaries who “turned red” after spilling blood in a border war.|
|**Intimidation (15)**|15|Reading their body language, the PCs can tell that a bold, aggressive stand could rattle them (the men are not hardened veterans).|
|**Arcana (15)**|15|Their weapons faintly hum with residual magic—looted gear, not properly attuned.|

**Combat Special Actions**

**1. Collateral Threat**  
_Once per encounter._ The Captain fires an arrow or slashes a rope, causing a chandelier, brazier, or stacked crates to crash down. All creatures in a **10 ft. radius** must make a **DC 14 Dexterity save** or take **2d6 bludgeoning damage** and be restrained beneath debris until they use an action to escape.

**2. Cheap Shot**  
_Once per encounter._ After a PC makes an attack against the Captain (hit or miss), he lashes out with a sudden dirty blow—knee to the gut, pommel to the face. The PC must succeed on a **DC 14 Strength save** or be **knocked prone** and take **1d6 bludgeoning damage**.

> _“Shoulda kept your guard up!”_

**3. Hostage Grab**  
_Once per encounter._ The Captain grapples a nearby creature (DC 14 to escape) and drags them at **half speed**. When targeted by an attack, roll **1d4**; on a **1**, the hostage is hit instead. This effect ends when the Captain is hit.

> _“This is what happens to anyone who crosses the Crimson Watch!”_

#### The Corrupted Orchard

> The orchard is eerily quiet. Rows of once-proud apple trees twist under the weight of shriveled, black-spotted fruit. The air smells of sour rot and damp soil. Here and there, branches drip with a faint violet sheen, as though the corruption itself has seeped into the wood.
> 
> As you step between the trees, you notice an **elf** standing in the clearing near a small stone well. His cloak is patched and mud-stained, his face gaunt from sleepless nights. A **crossbow is leveled at you**, and his eyes are wide, bloodshot — full of suspicion.

> **Elf Farmer (gruff, voice tight):**  
> "Stop right there! Who are you, and what do you want on my land? Speak true, or by the Light, I'll put a bolt through you."

_If the party calms him down (Persuasion DC 14, or simply being respectful):_

> **Elf Farmer (lowering the crossbow, but still wary):**  
> "You don't look like raiders… Forgive me. There have been too many attacks. Too many shadows in the fields at night. I can't be too careful."

> (he gestures weakly at the trees)  
> "See what's become of my orchard? Every crop spoiled. The fruit's black, bitter — cursed, I swear. I've burned what I could, but still the rot spreads. And the well—" (he shudders) "—there's something wrong down there. The well has completely dried up."

_If pressed about the fruit or nightmares:_

> **Elf Farmer (voice breaking, almost pleading):**  
> "The neighbors won't touch my apples, and those who have—gods help them—wake screaming in the night. Faces pale, as if the life's been drained from them. I don't know how much longer I can last. If you've any mercy, look into the well. Maybe you'll see what I fear to face."


At the bottom of the well lies a **Corrupted Bloom**, a massive underdark flower-entity spreading glowing tendrils through the soil. It explains the rot in the orchards and the nightmares plaguing those who eat its tainted fruit.

##### Corrupted Bloom 

**Passive Effects**:
- **Draining Aura (30 ft radius):** Living creatures that start their turn in the chamber must make a **DC 15 Con save** or take **1d6 necrotic damage** as the Bloom leeches vitality. Plants and natural food rot instantly within this aura.
- **Nightmare Spores:** Anyone who touches the vines or eats tainted fruit must make a **DC 15 Wis save** or suffer a nightmare that night, gaining **1 level of exhaustion** on waking.

**Combat Behavior**: The **Corrupted Bloom** is _stationary_ but dangerous, lashing out through tendrils and calling void-spawn when threatened.
- **Tendrils (Reach 20 ft, +7 to hit, 2d8 bludgeoning + 1d8 necrotic, grapple on hit DC 15).**
- **Corruption Pulse (Recharge 5–6):** The flower releases a psychic wave. Everyone within 30 ft must make a **DC 15 Wis save** or take **3d6 psychic damage** and be **frightened until end of next turn**.

**Environmental Defenses**: When the Bloom takes radiant/fire damage (sunlight, holy fire, etc.), it reacts violently.
- **Summon Voidlings:** 1d4 **Void Spawn** (use Shadow stat block, MM p.269, but give them glowing blue eyes and necrotic claws) appear to defend it.
- **Vine Whip:** The chamber shakes; stalactites fall (Dex save DC 14, 2d6 bludgeoning).

**Weaknesses**: 
- **Sunlight Vulnerability:** If exposed to natural sunlight or radiant spells (e.g. _Daylight_, _Sunbeam_, _Sacred Flame_), the Bloom takes **double damage**.
- **Holy Fire:** Fire damage from divine sources (like a paladin's smite, cleric spells, or consecrated flame) bypasses its resistances.

**Loot/Resolution**: If destroyed, the vines wither instantly, and the soil begins to heal. Within a week, crops slowly return.
