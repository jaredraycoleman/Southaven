# Creature Page Creation Instructions

## Location
Creatures should be placed in the `/Creatures` directory of the vault.

## Properties
- If the entire creature should not be known yet to the players, set the `public` flag in the properties to `false`
- Information that should be hidden from players and only visible to the DM should be in `%% %%` comment blocks

## Markdown Format

```md
## Description
[2-3 sentence physical description of the creature]

## Behavior
[2-3 sentences on how the creature acts, its temperament, habitat]

## Background
[optional notes on where the creature was encountered, relation to story with wikilinks, etc.]
```

## Key Points

1. **Keep descriptions vivid** - 2-3 sentences focusing on appearance and distinctive features
2. **Use wikilinks** - Link to places, NPCs, and sessions where the creature appears
3. **DM-only info** - Use `%% %%` comment blocks for special abilities or secrets
4. **Description first** - Physical appearance and sensory details
5. **Behavior second** - How it acts, where it lives, what it wants
6. **Background optional** - Campaign-specific encounters and story connections
7. **Include ecology** - Habitat, diet, and relationship to environment when relevant
8. **Note variants** - Mention if this is a unique creature or a standard type with modifications
