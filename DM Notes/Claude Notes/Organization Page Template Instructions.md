# Organization Page Creation Instructions

## Location
Organizations should be placed in the `/Organizations` directory of the vault.

## Properties
- If the entire organization should not be known yet to the players, set the `public` flag in the properties to `false`
- Information that should be hidden from players and only visible to the DM should be in `%% %%` comment blocks

## Markdown Format

```md
## Description
[2-3 sentence overview of what the organization is and its purpose]

## Structure
[2-3 sentences on how the organization is structured, leadership, hierarchy]

## Background
[background of the organization's history and involvement in the campaign]
```

## Key Points

1. **Keep sections concise** - 2-3 sentences per section
2. **Use wikilinks** - Link to related NPCs, places, and other organizations
3. **DM-only info** - Use `%% %%` comment blocks for secrets and future plot hooks
4. **Description first** - Focus on what the organization does and stands for
5. **Structure second** - Explain leadership and how it's organized
6. **Background last** - History and campaign connections
7. **Include key members** - Reference important NPCs associated with the organization
8. **Note relationships** - Mention allies, enemies, or rival organizations when relevant
