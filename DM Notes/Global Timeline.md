# The Heroes of Southaven - Global Timeline

## **The Age of Creation** (Timeless/Pre-History)

### The World Builders
- **The World Builders** create countless worlds for their unseen masters
- **The Perfect World** is crafted - a paradise unlike any before
- **The First Betrayal**: Elandria and Faeren convince the other Builders to hide the world from their masters
- All Builders, including Taelkor, initially participate in concealing the world

---

## **The Age of Awakening** (~10,000 years before Solaran Calendar)

### **~10,000 BSC** (Before Solaran Calendar)
- **Taelkor's Disillusionment**: Consumed by guilt over their betrayal, Taelkor turns against the other Builders
- **The Awakening**: The Builders sacrifice their physical forms to create mortals with free will
  - Gods lose physical forms, becoming dependent on worship, rituals, and their claimed domains
  - They exist in near-total isolation in the void, with only flickering connections to reality through rare rituals
  - Taelkor refuses to participate, retaining his physical form and independence
  - For thousands of years, gods are barely aware of the world - nearly senseless, drifting between moments of clarity

### **~10,000-6,000 BSC - The Long War**
- **The War of Annihilation Begins**: Taelkor wages war directly against mortals, attempting to erase all life
- Mortals pray desperately to the gods, but receive only cryptic, fragmented responses
- Taelkor is banished and weakened repeatedly, but never truly destroyed
- Each time he returns, he is slightly weaker but more cunning
- Scattered civilizations rise and fall, barely surviving Taelkor's periodic returns

---

## **The Age of the Black Architect** (~4,000-3,300 BSC)

### **~4,000 BSC - Taelkor's Revelation**
- After millennia of failure, Taelkor finally understands: he can USE mortals, not just destroy them
- **The First Order of the Black Star** forms - mortals who believe the world is flawed and must be unmade
- Taelkor's cultists begin coordinated campaigns of destruction
- This is the true beginning of organized apocalyptic warfare

### **~3,700-3,500 BSC - The Architect's Ascendancy**
- Black Star armies sweep across the known world
- **The Deadlands are created** - Taelkor's greatest display of power, an entire region reduced to lifeless waste
- Multiple kingdoms and early civilizations are completely annihilated
- The gods, still barely conscious in the void, struggle to respond
- Desperate mortals create primitive temples and develop powerful rituals to strengthen their connection to the gods

### **~3,500 BSC - The Age of Relics**
- As defeat seems imminent, mortal heroes create legendary artifacts to combat Taelkor
- **The Relics of Power are forged**:
  - Location and nature of each relic developed by mortal ingenuity and desperate divine inspiration
  - Each relic channels a fragment of divine power without requiring constant godly awareness
  - The relics become weapons, shields, and tools that can harm Taelkor directly

### **~3,350-3,300 BSC - The Final War**
- United mortal armies, wielding the Relics, launch their final assault
- **~3,300 BSC - The Last Battle**:
  - Occurs in what is now the [[Elfwood]]
  - Devastation nearly destroys the entire region
  - Forests burn, mountains crack, leylines rupture
  - Taelkor is finally defeated and banished - not destroyed, but weakened beyond recovery (for now)
  - The victory comes at terrible cost: entire cities lost, bloodlines ended, knowledge destroyed

---

## **The Age of Recovery** (~3,300-1,000 BSC)

### **~3,300-3,250 BSC - Immediate Aftermath**
- Surviving mortals work to heal the shattered lands
- The Elfwood is dying from the destruction of the Last Battle
- Druids of [[Faeren]] gather to save what remains
- **~3,280 BSC - The Ring of Verdant Stillness is forged**:
  - Created by [[Circle of Verdant Flame]]'s greatest druids as an emergency measure
  - Intended to stabilize the Elfwood's leylines temporarily (a few decades at most)
  - Bound to three major groves: [[Myrlen'Thal, The Grove of Morning]], [[Telor'Augus, The Grove of Fire]], and [[Shael'Nareth, The Grove of Twilight]]
  - **Gifted to Queen Aelra Sylanthiel** - a young elf who showed exceptional leadership during the crisis
  - The ring works: the Elfwood stabilizes and enters an unnatural but beautiful stasis

### **~3,200-3,000 BSC - The Ember Halls Era**
- **~3,000 BSC - The Ember Halls are constructed** in [[The Pale Mountains]]
  - Built by an ancient dwarven civilization as a fortress-city
  - Serves as a beacon of hope and reconstruction
  - Becomes a center of learning, preserving knowledge from before the Last Battle

### **~3,000-1,500 BSC - Scattered Kingdoms**
- Various city-states and kingdoms rise across the world
- The gods slowly become more present as worship and rituals grow stronger
- Different sects emerge worshipping individual gods
- [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]] continues using the Ring, telling herself it's still necessary
- Decades turn to centuries; the "temporary" measure becomes permanent

### **~1,500-500 BSC - Age of Division**
- Multiple kingdoms vie for power
- Religious conflicts between different godly sects
- The Ember Halls decline but remain inhabited
- Queen Aelra rules over Vel Enweir (which will later become [[Balandel]]), her realm sustained by the Ring
- No one remembers the Ring's true purpose anymore - even the druids believe Faeren simply blessed the forest

## **Important Historical Context**

### The Gods' Isolation
For thousands of years after the Awakening, the gods existed in near-total sensory deprivation in the void. Their connection to the mortal world was so tenuous that they could barely perceive events, let alone intervene. This explains:
- Why divine communication is often cryptic and difficult
- Why the gods seem distant and incomprehensible to mortals
- Why mortals had to develop the Relics of Power themselves
- Why worship and rituals became so important (they strengthen the gods' connection to reality)

### The Ring's True History
The Ring of Verdant Stillness was created with good intentions as a temporary stabilizer. Queen Aelra has been using it for over 3,000 years - far beyond its intended purpose. This creates a dark parallel with Margatha's failed ritual 700 years ago - both attempted to halt natural cycles, though the Queen's method was initially sanctioned by the druids themselves.

### Margatha and the Swamp
The 700-year-old corruption of Blacktide Swamp predates Southaven by ~400 years. This means:
- The swamp was already a known danger when humans first settled the region
- Aramond's Lookout was partially established to monitor threats from the swamp
- The Ancient Rotwood Stalker has been trapped in undeath for seven centuries
- When the party killed Margatha in Session 3, they ended her mortal existence, but the cult has now raised her as a Death Hag

### The Cycle of the Black Star
The Order of the Black Star has risen and fallen multiple times:
1. First organized ~4,000 BSC under Taelkor's direct command
2. Defeated along with Taelkor ~3,300 BSC
3. Scattered remnants persisted through the ages
4. Reorganized ~1217 SC under Malrith Kelbirn
5. Currently at peak power, orchestrating the Siege of Southaven
