_Even the brightest flame must cast a shadow,  
But darkness—  
Darkness needs no light._

_It will rise again,  
A black hand stretching wide  
To smother the world in ash and silence._

_The light will falter.  
The world will fade._

_And then—_  
_A spark.  
Wild and divine.  
A memory of fire lost in time.  
An explosion against the void._

_Hammer, Ring, and Crown will stand at her side—  
The last relics of an ancient, unending battle._

_Together they will face the Black Star,  
And his twin wings of ruin._

_And for a time,  
The dark will sleep._

## Naelúmë Syl'thera – Song of the Wild Spark

> _Even the flame in morning's bloom  
> Casts her shadow long and deep.  
> But night, O night, she needs no flame—  
> She waits, she watches, she does not sleep._
> 
> The hand of dark shall rise once more,  
> With wings that blot the sky.  
> Ash shall fall where flowers grew,  
> And silence be their cry.
> 
> The light shall flicker, thin and pale,  
> As stars forget their name.  
> The world shall dim beneath the weight  
> Of shadow's ancient claim.
> 
> Then—  
> A spark shall rise where wild winds roam,  
> Born of chaos, light unknown.  
> A fire remembered in the bones,  
> An echo cast in stone.
> 
> Three shall stand where one stands tall:  
> The Hammer bright with battle's song,  
> The Crown that sees through veils and lies,  
> The Ring where whispers throng.
> 
> These relics of a war long passed,  
> Shall rise with her again.  
> To face the Black Star's cruel descent,  
> And break the tyrant's chain.
> 
> So sing, ye trees, of light once lost,  
> And flame that would not die.  
> For in her heart the dawn awakes,  
> And darkness learns to lie.

## Durûndal Varn – The Spark in the Deep

> _Even fire leaves shadow on stone.  
> Even light bows when night has grown.  
> But dark—aye, dark—needs naught to thrive.  
> It waits, deep-rooted. It stays alive._
> 
> It comes again on wings of black,  
> A hand to crush, a sky to crack.  
> Ash will fall like forge-born snow,  
> And silence take what hammers know._
> 
> Light shall wane, the halls grow cold,  
> The world forget the tales of old._
> 
> Then—  
> A spark shall flare from hearth and flame,  
> Wild-born, with no name.  
> Fire from a time near lost,  
> A blast to break the frost._
> 
> She shall rise, the Flame unbound,  
> With relics forged in sacred ground:  
> The Hammer, heavy with wrath of right.  
> The Crown, carved clear to pierce the night.  
> The Ring, that hears what none would speak—  
> Secrets sung from stone and creek._
> 
> With them she'll face the Star grown black,  
> And break his wings, and drive him back.
> 
> Let stone remember,  
> Let anvils sing—
> 
> That when dark came  
> It met the flame,  
> And did not win.

## The Spring She Brings

(_A Halfling Hearthsong for Late Winter_)

> _The snow is deep, the night is long,  
> But still we hum the hearthfire song.  
> For though the sky is cold and grey,  
> A brighter heart is on her way._
> 
> _She comes with bloom behind her trail,  
> A crown of flowers, soft and pale.  
> A hammer rings where frost once clung—  
> The song of spring already sung._
> 
> _A silver ring upon her hand,  
> A vow to wake the sleeping land.  
> With every step the rivers cheer,  
> And roots remember how to hear._
> 
> _So hang the pots and warm the bread,  
> And sweep the snow from garden bed.  
> The dark may grumble, growl, and bite—  
> But she is coming, full of light._
> 
> _And when she laughs, the cold will flee.  
> The world will bloom—  
> Just wait and see._


## Naelúmë Varûl – The Song of the Twin Wings

> _Even the brightest flame must fade,  
> And shadow claim her throne.  
> For night has no need of morning’s light,  
> It waits, it hungers, it is its own._
> 
> _A hand of black shall rise once more,  
> And silence bind the sky.  
> Ash shall fall where rivers sang,  
> And mortals learn to die._
> 
> _Then—  
> From the void, twin wings shall spread,  
> To bear the Star to life again.  
> The world unmade, the slate wiped bare,  
> A canvas cleansed of mortal sin._
> 
> _The Hammer broken,  
> The Ring cast down,  
> The Crown made blind,  
> Their lights gone out._
> 
> _So let the void embrace the world,  
> As was always meant to be.  
> For in the Architect’s perfect dark,  
> Only ruin sets us free._
