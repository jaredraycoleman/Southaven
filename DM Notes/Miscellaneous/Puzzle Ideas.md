## Seasons

**Setup:** The party enters a room with four murals, each depicting a different season. In the center is a small patch of dirt (a seed is buried within, unknown to the players).

**Goal:** Recreate each season in order.

**Notes:** Methods are open‑ended; matching the spirit of each season is enough. As each season is met, the murals glow and the room physically shifts.

**Order & Triggers:**

- **Spring: Rain:** Pour liquid on the dirt (water, _prestidigitation_, any liquid). A sprout emerges.
- **Summer: Sun:** Provide light or heat (e.g., _daylight_, torch, not directly scorching the plant). The sprout becomes a small tree.
- **Autumn: Wind:** Create airflow (even blowing). Leaves fall; tree becomes bare.
- **Winter: Snow:** Lower temperature or apply cold magic. A small cloud forms; snow/ice cover the tree; the exit opens.

## Homophone Statues

**Setup:** An altar is ringed by nine pedestals bearing statuettes: an abacist (man with abacus), a smith with hammer/forge, a warrior with spear, a warrior with bow, a prostitute, a bear, an apple, a rooster, and a quill. The altar has slots for three statuettes.

**Clue (spoken once):** "You who wish to be rewarded; choose the three that keep things sorted (/sordid/sworded)."

**Solution:** Choose the homophones of **sorted** → **sordid** → **sworded**:

- Sorted → **abacist** (keeps things sorted)
- Sordid → **prostitute**
- Sworded → **smith**

**Note:** Read the clue only once to preserve the heterography homophone trick.

## The Blood Wall

**Setup:** A stone wall with a locked door bears a riddle: _"The key is found within your head, use the key to paint me red; beware of what you spurn, for what you give shall be returned."_

**Solution:** Smear **blood** on the wall/door. A duplicate of the blood's source emerges and must be defeated to unlock the door.

**Uses:** Gate progress; conceal secret rooms or treasure.

**Alternatives:**

- Alternate riddle: _"Use your head to paint me red; inside of thee resides your key."_
- Forgo the fight if a **key** is painted precisely.
- Only the blood‑giver becomes the "key" who can open the door.
- Include a magical easel or canvas to draw upon.

**Possible Magic Item:**

- **Crystallizing Blood:** A small blood‑red gem with fluid within. Speaking a command while gripping it forms a **Crimson Crystal Dagger**.

## The Lockpicking Door

**Setup:** A door (smugglers' den/bank) has seven locks labeled in various languages and a central iron handle. Thieves' Cant above is a red herring description of the room contents.

**Locks:**

1. "Open": Common
2. "Close": Elvish
3. "Open": Dwarvish
4. "Close": Infernal
5. "Open": Giant
6. "Close": Halfling
7. "Close": Undercommon

**Solution:** Pick **only** locks labeled "Open" (e.g., DC 10). Leave "Close" locks shut. Then turn the handle to avoid the central lightning rune trap.

**Uses:** Gate progress; protect secrets/treasure.

**Alternatives:**
- Include more exotic languages.
- Picking a "Close" lock sets off a smaller trap. Swap the lightning rune for other effects.

## Painted Into a Corner

**Setup:** A room contains a landscape painting radiating faint neutral magic. During a long rest in the room, sleepers awaken inside the painting.

**Details:** Creatures in the painted world carry small bottles of a strong, clear liquid (turpentine).

**Solution:** Splashing turpentine deals heavy acid damage **inside** the painting. Any creature reduced to 0 HP in the painted world awakens in the real room, freeing them from the trap.

**Uses:** A surreal side diversion.

**Alternatives:** A key pictured in the painting is required to proceed; add an inscription beneath the frame.

**Possible Magic Item:**
- **Painter's World Turpentine:** Splash to inflict strong acid damage.

## The One‑Way Hall

**Setup:** A normal‑looking hallway ends at a dead end. Turning around reveals a wall 5 feet behind you. On the end wall: "Keep your eye here and you may escape."

**Solution:** Stare at the inscription and walk backward to exit.

**Uses:** Gate progress; hide secrets.

**Alternatives:**
- Change text to "Retrace your steps."
- The rear wall bears a massive eye that closes if looked away from.

## Petrified Key

**Setup:** A statue of a man stares at a Medusa statue. The required key around his neck is stone and cannot be removed.

**Solution:** Break line of sight (e.g., cover the man's eyes). He returns to life and gives the key; possibly serves as a guide. Optionally, animate the Medusa for a combat.

**Alternatives:**
- Use a Basilisk instead.
- The man holds a reflective round shield; he petrified himself via reflection. Moving the shield from the Medusa's gaze reanimates her.

## Dark Staircase

**Setup:** A stairway descends into pitch black beneath an inscription: _"Life leads us down dark roads, but sometimes that is necessary to see the light."_ Endless stairs exhaust the party; turning around is endless as well.

**Solution:** Extinguish all light sources; creatures with Darkvision must close their eyes. Proceed in true darkness.

**Uses:** Gate progress; attrition before upcoming fights.

**Alternate Inscriptions:**
- "The road may be dark, yet oft‑times light does naught but blind."
- "Embrace the dark; those who do may end up in the light."
- "Are you so blinded by your sight that you cannot find your way?"
- "Life has paths that cannot be seen and must be felt."
- "Sometimes in life we must move forward with blind faith."
- "In times of trial, the path we see can blind us to the path we must take."

**Notes:** _Darkness_ cast on the area can also end the staircase.

**Possible Magic Item:**
- **Gem of Darkness:** Cast _darkness_ once before expending its magic.

## Back to the Drawing Board

**Setup:** A pedestal bears a maze map with a marked "important" symbol in the center and a marked exit that appears inaccessible. Across the room lies the physical maze. The map has limited erasable areas (do **not** make all erasable).

**Solution:** The central marked object in the maze is an **eraser**. Using it on the original map removes a wall, opening the exit.

**Uses:** Add challenge to a maze.

**Alternatives:**
- Carved map with a chisel instead of an eraser.
- A portal near the pedestal and eraser to avoid a full backtrack.

**Possible Magic Item:**
- **Maximus Erasor:** Erases pencil/charcoal/ink from any surface without trace.

## Trapsweeper

**Setup:** A large checkerboard room; some tiles are trapped. Stepping on a trapped tile changes its color and triggers a random trap. Checks reveal only the **number** of adjacent trapped tiles, not locations. Goal is to cross the room.

**Solution:** It's **minesweeper**—infer safe tiles, advance to the far side.

**Uses:** Replace generic trap checks with a logic puzzle.

**Alternatives:**
- Add monsters to force time pressure; add treasure on the far side.
- Some traps release caged monsters below the tiles.

## The Other Door

**Setup:** The party finds a locked door that's easy to pick; beyond lies a hall to a second, very hard lock. A keyring hangs nearby, but none of its keys fit the second door. Forcing/picking it reveals only a solid wall beyond.

**Solution:** Return to the **first** door, close it, and use **any** key from the ring to unlock it; it now opens to a different area.

**Alternatives:**
- Several doors open their opposite counterparts.
- Every key opens the second door—but loops you back to the same hall unless the **right** key is used.

**Possible Magic Item:**
- **Keyring of Annoyance:** The correct key is always the last untried key on any door.

## The Greatest Weapon

**Setup:** A weapon‑lined room surrounds a statue of a knight with an outstretched hand. Plaque: _"Bring to me the greatest weapon, that kings covet, puts warriors to ruin, and ends all battles."_ Any weapon placed animates and attacks.

**Solution:** Find the weapon named **Peacemaker**—a blade entwined with an **olive branch**. Place the **olive branch** (symbol of peace) in the statue's hand to solve.

**Uses:** Gate progress; reward with thematic weapons.

**Alternatives:**
- A simple twig among the racks instead of a decorated blade.
- Name tags on weapons (e.g., "Deathbringer," "Oathshatter") as red herrings.
- Nature/History checks identify the olive branch symbolism.

**Possible Magic Item:**
- **Olive Branch / Peacemaker:** Longsword; wielder can cast _calm emotions_.

## Make Me Talk

**Setup:** A sentient door demands a password, insisting the answer "must be spoken."

**Solution:** The **door** must speak the password—trick or coax it into saying the answer.

**Uses:** Deceptively simple gate.

**Alternatives:**
- Give the door a personality (haughty, irritable, smarmy).
- On success, the door's visage cracks/explodes—explaining why it won't volunteer the password.

## Roy G. Biv's Magnificent Hall

**Setup:** A long hall traps the incautious. One wall holds a mural with seven gemstones (rainbow colors). Opposite are candleholders with candles that burn in various colors—but not in matching order.

**Solution:** Arrange candles so each colored flame aligns with its matching gemstone to open the way.

**Uses:** Hide secret rooms; gate progress.

**Alternatives:**

- Add buttons under holders; wrong presses trigger traps/monsters.
- Include extra empty holders as decoys.
- Fixed holders; gems appear "random"—the gem order dictates candle placement.

**Possible Magic Item:**

- **Candle in the Wind:** Everlasting, cannot be extinguished.

## Maiden's Sacrifice

**Setup:** A blood‑stained altar with a drain. Inscription: _"The maiden's sacrifice is necessary for life."_ Fresh spring water flows around, with a ladle; a mural shows a woman of water.

**Solution:** Pour **fresh spring water** into the altar. Blood is a red herring and may trigger traps or alter murals.

**Uses:** Red‑herring irritation; reactive encounter.

**Alternatives:** Remove the blood and mural entirely.

**Possible Magic Items:**
- **Maiden's Gift:** Pale blue crystal; while attuned, drinking spring water grants temporary HP.
- **Maiden's Tainted Gift:** Dark crystal; cast _destroy water_.

## Cursed Passage Stones

**Setup:** A room contains colored stones—one per character—and an invisible barrier blocks the exit. Picking up a stone afflicts a character with a curse; **no one can describe their own curse.** When a character's curse is identified aloud in general terms, they can pass through the barrier; the curse ends beyond. A hidden clue appears when all are cursed: _"When your affliction is identified, only then may you pass."_

**Example Curses:**

- You can speak only while someone else is speaking—and must talk loudly over them.
- You cringe in pain or fear whenever a word containing the letter **F** is spoken.
- You cannot use nouns except pronouns; only "thing" and "jack‑in‑the‑box" are allowed as exceptions.
- Three words into each sentence, you must stop and think; sentences of three words or fewer are only: "Let me think," "Hang on," "Shush."

**Solution:** Identify each person's curse and pass through.

**Uses:** Fun social puzzle; gate progress.

**Alternatives:** Design your own curses.

## The Mirrored Instructions

**Setup:** A fire‑filled room; some flames are illusions. A scorched paper on the floor explains this and gives a route—but the text is **mirrored**.

**Solution:** The instructions themselves must be mirrored to be followed—reverse them and take the route's mirror.

**Uses:** Gate progress; controlled damage risk.

**Alternatives:** Replace fire with walls or another hazard.

**Possible Magic Item:**
- **Red‑Hot Ring:** Glows near fire.

## The Empty Gauntlet

**Setup:** A small round room (10–15 ft). A shallow stone‑walled well is centered; opposite stands a statue pointing its index finger down. The statue's tablet reads: _"Be humbled, trespasser… you believe your destination is beneath you, but you mustn't miss the point."_ Two feet below the water floats a blue‑glowing metal gauntlet, immovable unless worn. Water level is 1.5 ft above the gauntlet.

**Mechanics:** Wearing the gauntlet locks the wrist; the well floor descends and water rises. The wearer must solve the door before drowning.

**Solution:** Mimic the statue's **pointing‑down** gesture. This halts water, reverses the mechanism, frees the hand, and lowers the entire room as an elevator into the area below.

**Uses:** Gate progress; potential reward.

**Alternatives:** Lower the platform instead of raising water.

**Possible Magic Item:**
- **Gauntlet of the Way of Water:** _Water walk_ once per day for 2 minutes.

## The Scales

**Setup:** A balance scale blocks a door/chasm. Several figurines (possibly found around the dungeon) have symbols underneath indicating weights or equivalences.

**Solution:** Balance both pans equally to proceed.

**Uses:** Open doors, cross chasms, halt traps, reveal secrets.

**Alternatives:** Add a riddle to pick the two correct items.

**Example Riddle:** "Looks deceive; a **heavy heart** can weigh one down like **lead**." (Place a heart and a lead figurine.)

## A Matter of Perspective

**Setup:** A circular room with 8 pressure plates at compass points. Grooves run from plates to a central pile of rubble. Across the room: "It's all a matter of perspective." Stepping on plates causes rubble to float into words—**each player sees a different word**, but all share a theme (e.g., dew/river/ice/mist → water).

**Solution:** Identify and say the **theme** aloud to open the double doors.

**Uses:** Gate progress.

## Build‑an‑Armor Set

**Setup:** A door seals behind the party. A Warforged appears in a crystal, explaining that assembling a certain suit of armor is the key to exit. The room contains many cursed armor pieces (you can't leave with them) of varied types and levels.

**Solution:** Insert the correct pieces in the wall slots to open the door. The magic suit removes the curse and grants one chosen armor piece as a reward.

**Uses:** Reward armor; gate progress; unlock secrets.

## Mirror, Mirror

**Setup:** A room with a large rectangular mirror. Stepping through transports you to a mirrored realm. Turning to exit fails—the portal won't open.

**Solution:** Exit while **facing the same direction** as entry—walk **backwards** through the portal.

**Uses:** Isolate or trap a character; short logic gate.

**Alternatives:** The mirror shows a key needed to progress and only certain people can enter.

## Narcissist Puzzle

**Setup:** A slightly cluttered room (e.g., bedroom or chest‑filled). A statue gazes into a mirror, smiling. When approached, it says, "Only the most beautiful may pass," and returns to admiring itself. Clothing items lie around; some match the statue's outfit.

**Solution:** A character dons a **matching set** of clothing. The statue compliments their style and reveals the door. If approached without a match, it insults them and summons a monster.

**Alternatives:** If a character also mimics the statue's face (illusions), the statue gushes and grants a magic item.

**Possible Magic Item:**

- **Narcissist's Charm:** +1 Charisma; _charm person_ 1/long rest (form varies: ring/medallion/gaudy hat).

## Runic Hallways

**Setup:** A door bears the message: "Walk these halls and return to me; a letter is the key." The dungeon corridors form the shape of a rune/letter when mapped.

**Solution:** Touch the **correct letter/rune** on the door to unlock—or trigger a trap if wrong. (Provide your own rune map.)

**Uses:** Damage risk; gate progress.

## The Way In (Letter Grid)

**Setup:** A 5×5 letter grid on a panel. Players press letters to spell a password/passphrase.

**Grid:**

```
Q N M E K
X O I P S
U Y S H O
A W E T I
Z H T L C
```

**Rules:**

1. Each next letter must be **adjacent** (including diagonals).
2. You **cannot** repeat a rune/letter already chosen.
3. You must move **bottom‑to‑top** overall.

**Solution:** Spell the answer to a riddle (provide/foreshadow the riddle elsewhere).

**Uses:** Blocks a door, chest, portal, etc.

**Alternatives:** Knight's‑move variant (like a chess horse).

## Rocky Elevator Ride

**Setup:** An elevator begins descending as soon as touched/entered. Each round, one of three traps triggers in sequence: falling rocks (from above), poison darts (from walls), floor spikes. The elevator has interior/roof/half‑walls that allow positioning to avoid each hazard. A center column has three buttons.

**Trap Cycle:**

- Round 1: Button 1 depressed → rocks fall.
- Round 2: Button 1 releases; Button 2 depresses → darts.
- Round 3: Button 2 releases; Button 3 depresses → spikes.
- Round 4: Button 3 releases; Button 1 depresses → rocks (cycle repeats).

**Solution:** Predict and pre‑press the **next** button in the sequence so the upcoming trap is suppressed (e.g., press Button 2 during Round 1, etc.). Repeat to null the cycle.

**Alternatives:**

- Vary traps, timing, number of rounds.
- Add a fight (fliers are especially nasty).

## Pressure Plate Hallway

**Setup:** A ~30‑ft hall with column pairs every 2–5 ft. Each span between columns is a pressure plate that, when triggered, fires arrows from the columns after a one‑second delay.

**Solution:** **Run** the hall rather than creeping; don't tailgate or you'll eat the previous person's arrows.

**Uses:** Unique traversal challenge.

**Alternatives:** Any delayed trap works; ensure delay is perceptible.

## A Puzzle of Numbers

**Setup:** A chalkboard shows two dotted rows and the heading "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8." A piece of magical chalk is provided.

**Solution:** Realize the task is to **write how many of each digit appear**.

- Final tally to write:
    - Top row: `2 6 6 6 6 6`
    - Bottom row: `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 4 4`
- Reasoning: There is one **2**, three **4**s, five **6**s, and seven **8**s.
    

**Uses:** Light riddle; brief annoyance.

## The Enchanted Poison

**Setup:** A large bottle of deadly poison sits in the center. Above the exit is a carved face with an open mouth; pouring poison into it opens the door. Touching the bottle causes the face to sing a drinking song, magically **compelling the toucher to drink**. The compulsion transfers to anyone who yanks the bottle away.

**Solution Ideas:** (Provide one or let them improvise)

- Levitate/telekinesis/mage hand to pour without touching.
- Use tongs, a pole, or a sack with a drawstring to avoid direct contact.
- Decant via siphon set up hands‑free.

**Uses:** Creativity test; gate progress.

## The Dragon's Offering

**Setup:** A square room with a central well and a table of gemstones, metal shards, and ores. A dragon statuette with an open mouth sits on the table; a riddle is carved into the surface. Wrong attempts begin flooding the chamber.

**Solution:** Place the **correct offering** in the dragon's mouth based on the riddle.

**Sample Riddles & Answers:**

- "Gems and stones I devour whole; for a taste of this **Red** all else I turn to coal." → **Ruby**
- "Crimson and fluid. Drip it into my mouth and I'll chew it." → **Blood**
- "Of late I have a mind of metal. Yellow and soft, for nothing else shall I settle." → **Gold**

**Uses:** Gate access to a room/chest.

## Rise of the Poor

**Setup:** A grand hall lined with knight statues; one pedestal stands empty. Next to it, a beggar statue holds out a bowl. Plaques read, in order:

1. "A beggar's lot in life seems solid like stone."
2. "Give him what he needs for the day and he shall thank you with grace."
3. "Heal his wounds and he shall walk."
4. "Bring him a blade and he will stand ennobled."
5. "Now a knight of the order, he will rise."

**Solution:** Place **food/coin**, a **healing potion**, and a **weapon** into the bowl. With each, a portion of the statue lights. The beggar moves to the empty pedestal; the way opens.

**Uses:** Gate progress; grant a blessing or item.

**Alternatives:** Attempting to proceed without ennobling the beggar animates all statues to attack.

---

## Light Channels Through You

**Setup:** A sealed door without a lock. Three colored light beams (green, red, blue) enter the room. A large crystal stands in the center; a smaller crystal sits above the door. Inscription: _"As people have worked together to advance throughout all of time, so too must you to see the true light."_ Each corner has a dust‑covered copper disk.

**Solution:** Guide all **three** beams into the large crystal to produce a **white** beam, then guide that beam to the small crystal above the door.

**Uses:** Gate progress.

**Alternatives:**

- Remove or change the inscription (e.g., "Three become one; one with the strength of three overcomes all obstacles.")

**Possible Magic Item:**

- **Small Crystal of Light:** Emits light like the _light_ cantrip, in a color of choice.
