- The group decoded the message from [[Lyrian Brightwind]] "We are resisting. Fighting. Tell [[Velara Kael|Velara]] I love her. Tell [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] I found Leonard."
- The party told Velara the message and then went to [[Shael'Nareth, The Grove of Twilight]]
- In the grove, they found druids fighting against wights who were protecting crystals.
- [[Lirielle]] noticed the crystals were opening up a portal
- Ferinthria and Lirielle did devastating damage with chromatic orb, jumping multiple times to different targets and shattering the crystals
- [[Dravencoles]] felt useless at range with his bow, so he sprinted up to one of the wights to attack with his hammer
- [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] noticed the outline of a dragon on the other side of the portal and told the druids to target the crystals - they obeyed
- The wights attacked the druids and drained their life
- Ferinthria's wild magic surged and, in a stroke of incredible luck, caused her to heal herself and allies, regain spell slots, and regain her sorcery points.
- The party destroyed the crystals, but not before a juvenile shadow dragon flew through the portal.
- Momeline successfully caused the dragon to sleep and it went unconscious after two failed saves.
- After defeating the remaining wights, the druids came over, thanked the party for their help, and began a ritual to restrain the juvenile shadow dragon in roots
- The party returned through the portal to the verdant reliquary and went into the last remaining portal to the [[Telor'Augus, The Grove of Fire]].
- Inside they found the [[Archdruid Thalwen Myr]] and her druids of the flame had taken care of most of the cultists already. All that remained were some steam mephits, which they dispatched quickly. The Archdruid was very stern and asked who the party were. After mentioning they had been sent by the [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel|Queen]] to help, she said she would be in touch shortly after questioning some captured cultists to "find out what the hell is going on".
- The party went back through the portal and found that the Queen had regained consciousness. She thanked them for their help and decided to retire to her chambers.
- The party asked for [[Talan Windfern]] to be taken in for questioning.
- The party went back to the Scarlet Shield Tavern and met up with Finn and Tilly.
- [[Finnathan Thistle|Finn]] and [[Tilly Thistle|Tilly]] let the party know they continued their research and found more info on Momeline's crown:

> **Finn (looking up from a thick leather folio):**  
> _"I've found a bit more information on that crown of yours, Momeline. Its origin traces back to a place called "Khasim's Crown"—once the capital of a desert empire. The high magisters forged many of the relics used in the first war."_
> 
> **Tilly (quietly):**  
> _"They say no wind ever moves through Khasim's ruins. Like even the air remembers what happened there."_
> 
> **Finn (more cautiously):**  
> _"The Crown of Judgement was one of their final creations. Likely forged in secret, it wasn't meant to be worn by just anyone. Everything I've found points to this: someone with a natural connection to fate is required to awaken it. Not just to wear it, but to truly attune to its purpose."_
