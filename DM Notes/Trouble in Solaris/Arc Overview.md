# Trouble in Solaris - Campaign Arc Overview

## Arc Summary

The **"Trouble in Solaris"** arc reveals that [[Kingdom of Solara]]'s leadership crisis is not merely political friction—it's the result of a years-long Black Star Cult operation to destroy the kingdom from within. [[Castellan Verin]], a deep-cover cultist, spent five years systematically poisoning [[Luminarch Theodric Brightspire]]'s mind, driving a wedge between Crown and Church. When Theodric unexpectedly left for [[Lusteris]], Verin pivoted to an even more dangerous target: [[King Aldric IX Solborn]] himself.

Now, with the Luminarch gone and the King's mind corrupted, [[Castellan Verin]] has paralyzed Solara's ability to respond to the [[Southaven]] crisis. The party must navigate court politics, uncover a nearly perfect conspiracy, and save a paranoid king who sees enemies everywhere—all while the [[Order of the Black Star]] prepares its final, devastating move.

## Arc Structure

### **Act 1: Arrival and Investigation**
The party arrives in Solaris and witnesses the dysfunction firsthand. The King seems paranoid and erratic, refusing to send aid to Southaven despite the siege. They must navigate court politics while looking for the source of the King's strange behavior.

### **Act 2: Uncovering the Truth**
Through investigation and possibly divine intervention, the party discovers evidence of Aldric's manipulation and Verin's true identity. They may also learn that Theodric is in Lusteris and was previously poisoned.

### **Act 3: The Race Against Time**
Once exposed, Verin and the cult will accelerate their plans. The party must prevent total collapse while saving Aldric and possibly retrieving Theodric from Lusteris.

### **Act 4: Consequences and Resolution**
Even if the party succeeds, the damage is done. Solara must rebuild trust in its leadership while dealing with the cult's broader threat. Theodric's return could help or complicate matters.

## Key Themes

- **Corruption from Within:** The most dangerous enemies work from inside institutions
- **Gradual Evil:** Small compromises and subtle influences lead to terrible outcomes
- **The Cost of Legacy:** Aldric's fear of being remembered as a failure is weaponized against him
- **Trust and Betrayal:** Years of work can be destroyed by a single act of treachery
- **Adaptation:** Verin's ability to pivot from one target to another shows cult's flexibility

## When to Run This Arc

**Timing Options:**

1. **During Siege of Southaven:** Party realizes no reinforcements are coming because King Aldric refuses to send them, believing Southaven plans to secede
2. **After Initial Southaven Success:** Party returns victorious but learns Solaris is paralyzed, preventing further aid
3. **Royal Summons:** A loyal courtier secretly contacts party to investigate the King's strange behavior
4. **Theodric Connection:** If party travels to Lusteris, they might encounter Theodric and learn about the situation

**Prerequisites:**
- Party should be at least level 8-10 to handle the political and combat challenges
- They should have established reputation (especially with Southaven/Lord Kael) that makes them targets of Aldric's paranoia
- Connection to either Southaven or the Church makes hooks easier

## Major NPCs

### **[[Luminarch Theodric Brightspire]]**
- Currently in Lusteris investigating cult activity
- Was previously poisoned by Verin (1262-1267)

## Investigation Paths

The party can discover the truth through multiple avenues:

### **Path 1: Political Investigation**
- Attend court functions and observe King's behavior
- Interview nobles, clergy, and servants
- Notice patterns in Aldric's decision-making

### **Path 2: Divine Intervention**

- The gods themselves might be trying to warn their followers

**Key Clues:**
- Divine magic detects something wrong around the King

### **Path 3: Physical Evidence**

- **The Contemplation Chamber:** Where evening "prayers" happen (with poisoned incense)
- **The Guest Wing:** Where party might be housed (if not arrested)

### **The Grand Cathedral of Elandria**
- **The Sacred Sanctuary:** Main worship hall, Verin's official domain

## Connection to Larger Campaign

### **The Black Star's Grand Plan**

The Solaris operation is part of the cult's broader strategy:
- **Southaven Siege:** Military distraction and resource drain
- **Solaris Corruption:** Leadership paralysis prevents aid to Southaven
- **Lusteris Operations:** Keeps Theodric occupied and away
- **Ultimate Goal:** Weaken all major powers before [[Taelkor]]'s return

### **The Domino Effect**
- Aldric's paranoia prevents aid to Southaven
- Southaven's fall would devastate morale kingdom-wide
- Loss of Southaven opens path for cult to Solaris
- Kingdom weakened from within and without
- Perfect setup for Taelkor's return

### **Personal Stakes**

Connect the arc to character backgrounds:
- Party likely has connection to Southaven (Lord Kael, Velara, Brenlan)
- Aldric's refusal to send aid directly harms people they care about

## DM Tips

### **Pacing**
- Don't rush the investigation—let players feel clever discovering clues
- Build tension as they realize King's paranoia prevents Southaven aid
- Create time pressure once Verin knows he's exposed
- Balance political intrigue with action

### **Aldric's Paranoia**
- Make it clear but not cartoonish—he's genuinely convinced
- Show how Verin reinforces these fears subtly
- Let party see glimpses of the old Aldric (morning vs evening)
- Make saving him feel genuinely difficult

### **Red Herrings**
- Other nobles who seem suspicious but aren't cultists
- False leads about who's influencing the King
- Dead ends that waste party time (Verin's misdirection)
- Conflicting information from unreliable sources

### **Verin's Intelligence**
- He adapted from Theodric to Aldric—very capable
- Anticipates investigations and has contingencies
- Uses King's authority to deflect suspicion
- Don't make him omniscient, but very well-prepared

### **The Theodric Subplot**
- Finding him in Lusteris can be optional side quest
- He's a powerful ally if retrieved
- Creates interesting parallel—both leaders were poisoned
- His recovery gives hope for Aldric's recovery

### **Moral Complexity**
- Aldric is victim but his paranoia causes real harm
- Difficult choice: be gentle (slow) or forceful (risky)
