# Trouble in Solaris - Campaign Arc Overview

## Arc Summary

The **"Trouble in Solaris"** arc reveals that [[Kingdom of Solara]]'s leadership crisis is not merely political friction—it's the result of a years-long Black Star Cult operation to destroy the kingdom from within. [[Castellan Verin]], a deep-cover cultist, has spent five years systematically poisoning [[Luminarch Theodric Brightspire]]'s mind, turning the Church's spiritual leader into an unwitting agent of chaos and driving a wedge between Crown and Church.

This arc combines political intrigue, detective work, and moral complexity. The party must navigate Solaran court politics, uncover a nearly perfect conspiracy, and decide whether to save a man who has caused tremendous harm—all while the [[Order of the Black Star]] prepares its final, devastating move.

## Arc Structure

### **Act 1: Arrival and Investigation**
The party arrives in Solaris and witnesses the dysfunction firsthand. They must navigate court politics while looking for the source of the Crown-Church conflict.

### **Act 2: Uncovering the Truth**
Through investigation and possibly divine intervention, the party discovers evidence of Theodric's manipulation and Verin's true identity.

### **Act 3: The Race Against Time**
Once exposed, Verin and the cult will accelerate their plans. The party must prevent civil war while saving Theodric and preserving the kingdom.

### **Act 4: Consequences and Resolution**
Even if the party succeeds, the damage is done. Solara must rebuild trust between Crown and Church while dealing with the cult's broader threat.

## Key Themes

- **Corruption from Within:** The most dangerous enemies work from inside institutions
- **Gradual Evil:** Small compromises and subtle influences lead to terrible outcomes
- **Moral Complexity:** Theodric is both victim and perpetrator—saving him is complicated
- **Trust and Betrayal:** Years of work can be destroyed by a single act of treachery
- **The Cost of Faith:** Blind devotion can be weaponized against believers

## When to Run This Arc

**Timing Options:**

1. **After Siege of Southaven:** The party returns victorious but learns Solaris is paralyzed by Crown-Church conflict, preventing reinforcements or supplies
2. **During Southaven Crisis:** King Aldric summons the party to investigate why the Luminarch is blocking military aid
3. **Independent Investigation:** The party hears rumors of trouble in the capital and investigates on their own
4. **Royal Summons:** Aldric secretly hires the party to find out why Theodric has changed

**Prerequisites:**
- Party should be at least level 8-10 to handle the political and combat challenges

- Some connection to either Church or Crown makes hooks easier

## Investigation Paths

The party can discover the truth through multiple avenues:

### **Path 1: Political Investigation**

### **Path 2: Divine Intervention**

## Connection to Larger Campaign

If the party is collecting sacred relics to combat Taelkor:
