## Hard Clues (DC 16-18 or Requires Specific Action)

### **The Incense**

**Clue:** The ceremonial incense contains unusual ingredients
- **Source:** Obtaining a sample and having it analyzed
- **Method:** 
  - Steal sample from Theodric's chambers (Stealth DC 16)
  - Convince a servant to provide some (Persuasion DC 17)
  - Attend evening prayers and grab used incense (Sleight of Hand DC 15)
- **Analysis:** 
  - Alchemist: DC 17 Intelligence check identifies Deadlands herbs
  - Herbalist: DC 18 Nature check recognizes psychoactive compounds

- **Source:** Investigating Church purchasing records
- **Requirements:** Access to records (breaking in, bribing clerk, or royal authorization)
- **Discovery:** Suppliers have connections to known cult fronts
- **Trail:** Can be traced back to Deadlands region

### **Verin's True Nature**

**Clue:** Verin's background story has inconsistencies

- **Discovery:** Small black star medallion, journal in cipher, cult materials
- **Risk:** If caught, party branded as thieves/heretics

**Clue:** Magical aura reveals something wrong
- **Source:** *Detect Evil and Good*, *See Invisibility*, or similar magic
- **Result:** Verin registers as "wrong" somehow
- **Details:** Not obviously evil, but unsettling
- **Note:** His magical forgettability might interfere with divination

### **The Conspiracy**

**Clue:** Other cult agents are watching Verin's operation
- **Source:** Counter-surveillance, tracking suspicious individuals
- **Discovery:** Multiple people watching the palace/cathedral
- **Pattern:** They're not targeting Theodric—they're *protecting* him

## Very Hard Clues (DC 19+ or Extreme Risk)

### **Verin's Journal**

**Clue:** Verin keeps a detailed record of the operation
- **Location:** Hidden in his private quarters behind a secret panel
- **Requirements:** 
  - Break into quarters undetected (Stealth DC 18)
  - Find the hidden compartment (Investigation DC 19)
  - Not get caught for 30+ minutes of searching
- **Contents:** Complete documentation of poisoning, timeline, cult plans
- **Language:** Written in cult cipher (DC 20 Intelligence to decode)
- **Risk:** If Verin discovers it's missing, he immediately accelerates final plan
- **Value:** This is definitive proof of everything

**Clue:** The cult's final revelation protocol is already prepared
- **Source:** Intercepting cult communications, captured agent interrogation
- **Discovery:** Documents ready to expose Theodric at optimal moment
- **Details:** Letters to nobles, evidence compiled, witnesses prepared
- **Implication:** The cult always planned to burn Verin as a pawn

### **Physical Evidence of Poisoning**

**Clue:** Theodric's body shows signs of long-term toxin exposure
- **Source:** Medical examination by very skilled healer/alchemist
- **Requirements:** Theodric's cooperation (unlikely) or examination of hair/nail clippings
- **DC 19 Medicine:** Identify specific toxin profile
- **Discovery:** Years of cumulative exposure, not acute poisoning
- **Evidence:** Can definitively prove he's been drugged

**Clue:** The incense burner in Theodric's chamber has residue buildup
- **Source:** Chemical analysis of the burner itself
- **Requirements:** Access to chamber, remove burner or scrape sample
- **DC 19 Alchemist Tools:** Identify complete compound mixture
- **Discovery:** Exact formula used, including psychoactive agents

### **Divine Revelation**

**Clue:** A god directly warns of the corruption
- **Source:** Divine intervention (DM plot device or high-level cleric magic)
- **Method:** Vision, direct communication, or angelic messenger
- **Details:** [[Elandria]] herself might be trying to warn her faithful
- **Message:** Cryptic but clear—her Luminarch is compromised
- **Challenge:** Getting Theodric to believe divine warning contradicts his own "divine" certainty

**Clue:** The Cathedral itself feels wrong to faithful
- **Source:** Very high Insight or Religion check in Cathedral (DC 20)
- **Sensation:** Divine presence is muffled, prayers feel hollow
- **Implication:** Corruption is so deep it affects sacred space
- **Insight:** The poisoned incense has been contaminating the air for years

## Special Investigation Techniques

### **Timeline Construction**

**Method:** Compile all dated events into chronological order
- When did Theodric's behavior change? (1262-1263)
- When did Verin arrive? (1262)
- When did Crown-Church conflict escalate? (1263-1264)
- When did specific policies change? (Document by document)
- **Pattern:** Everything traces back to Verin's arrival

### **Witness Interviews**

**Key Witnesses:**
- Old servants who knew Theodric before 1262
- Bishops who remember his earlier teachings
- Guards who've been posted at Cathedral for years
- Scribes who handle Theodric's correspondence
- The "wealthy patron" who "gifted" Verin (if they can be found)

**Red Flag Answers:**
- *"He's always been like this"* (from recent hires—Verin's allies)
- *"I don't remember"* (victims of Verin's forgettability magic)
- *"You shouldn't question the Luminarch"* (zealots or intimidated)
- *"Actually, now that you mention it..."* (genuine witnesses)

### **Surveillance Operations**

**Following Verin:**
- Extremely difficult (Stealth contested vs. his passive Perception 19)
- He takes anti-surveillance precautions
- Might lead to cult contacts or dead drops
- If he spots surveillance, he'll act to eliminate watchers

**Watching Theodric:**
- Easier but still monitored by guards
- Can observe behavior patterns
- Notice evening personality changes
- See when Verin is present vs. absent

### **Magical Investigation**

**Useful Spells:**
- *Detect Poison and Disease*: Incense registers as harmful
- *Zone of Truth*: Won't help with Verin (he believes his cause is righteous)
- *Detect Thoughts*: Might reveal Theodric's confusion or Verin's duplicity
- *Scrying*: Can watch Verin remotely (if not warded)
- *Divination*: May provide cryptic warnings
- *Commune*: Gods might answer questions about the corruption
- *Legend Lore*: Could reveal Verin's true identity

**Magical Defenses:**
- Verin has *Nondetection* cast regularly
- Cathedral has anti-scrying wards
- Some spells might alert Verin or Theodric to investigation

## Putting It Together

### **Minimum Evidence for Conviction:**

To prove the conspiracy, party needs:
1. **Proof of poisoning:** Incense analysis or medical evidence
2. **Proof of Verin's involvement:** Journal, cult connections, or witness testimony
3. **Proof of effect:** Theodric's behavior changes correlated with evidence
4. **Motive:** Connecting Verin to Black Star Cult

### **Convincing Theodric:**

Much harder than convincing others. Requires:
1. **Overwhelming evidence** he can't deny
2. **Gentle approach** that doesn't shatter his faith
3. **Time away from Verin** to clear his head
4. **Medical treatment** to detoxify
5. **Support from trusted clergy** he respects

### **Convincing King Aldric:**

Easier, but he needs:
1. **Solid evidence**, not just theories
2. **Plan for dealing with aftermath**
3. **Assurance Church won't collapse**
4. **Path to preserving Crown-Church alliance**
