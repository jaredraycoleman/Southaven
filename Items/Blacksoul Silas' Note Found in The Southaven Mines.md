> To Korvash,
> 
> Your reputation for discretion precedes you, and so I write with an offer suited to your talents. There are certain delicate materials I require - items best acquired by those untroubled by laws or conscience.
> 
> Among them:
> 
> The marrow of the long-dead, unearthed from graves where the soil still whispers.
> 
> The hands of the condemned, severed at the moment of their final breath.
> 
> Ash from a pyre where an oathbreaker burned, untouched by holy rites.
> 
> Bring these to me in secrecy, and the Black Star will see you paid in coin and favor. Fail, and the roads you haunt will soon haunt you in return.
> 
> -- Blacksoul S.
