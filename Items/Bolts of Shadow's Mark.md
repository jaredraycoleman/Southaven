## Description

These sinister bolts are crafted from blackened metal that seems to drink in the light around them. Wrapped in shadowy wisps that coil like smoke, each bolt pulses faintly with dark purple energy. When loaded, the crossbow itself grows cold to the touch, and a faint whisper—too quiet to understand—emanates from the bolt's tip.

The fletching appears to be made from raven feathers dipped in something viscous and wrong. Those struck by these bolts report feeling not just pain, but a cold emptiness, as if part of their essence was torn away.

## Mechanics

**Bolt of Shadow's Mark** (Rare Ammunition)

You have 2 bolts with this property. When you fire one of these bolts from a crossbow, make a ranged weapon attack as normal. On a hit, the target takes the crossbow's normal damage plus an additional **4d6 necrotic damage**.

Additionally, until the end of your next turn, the target is wreathed in flickering shadows. The next attack roll made against the marked creature has advantage, as the shadows guide the strike toward vulnerable points.

Once a bolt hits or misses, it crumbles to black ash and cannot be recovered.

## Notes

These bolts appear to be the same dark magic ammunition used by the assassin who ambushed the party on the road to [[Southaven]]. The necrotic energy within them feels similar to the corruption found in the cultists' magic—cold, hollow, and hungry.

[[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] claimed these from the assassin after the party captured him during the ambush on the fourth night of their journey from [[Balandel]].
