![[Elk of Myrlen'Thal_c243b6dd.webp]]

## Description

A majestic, radiant elk bound to the ancient grove of Myrlen'Thal. Its coat glows with the warmth of early morning light, and luminous druidic runes shimmer along its flanks and antlers. The elk is unnaturally graceful and radiates a quiet, ageless wisdom. Its presence wards against unnatural forces and its runes pulse softly when undead, fiends, or aberrations are near. Once bonded, it never loses track of its companion and carries a spark of healing magic drawn from the grove itself.

## History

In [[Session 18 - A Flower for the Dead]], the elk was saved by the party and it bound itself to [[Dravencoles]].
