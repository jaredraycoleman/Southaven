These apples grow on trees tainted by corruption. They appear glossy and red with faint violet veining beneath the skin, and they smell oddly sweet, almost intoxicating.

### Effects (When Eaten)

- **Immediate Taste:** The apple tastes delicious, unnaturally so, and the eater feels briefly invigorated. They regain **1d6 + 2 hit points**.
- **Nightmare Curse:** Within 1d4 hours, the eater must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or suffer disturbing visions when next they sleep.
    - On a failure, the creature gains **1 level of exhaustion** upon waking.
    - On a success, the dreams still come, but the creature awakens shaken and has **disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws** until their next long rest.
- **Lingering Taint:** If three or more Nightmare Apples are consumed within a week, the eater becomes **marked by the Bloom** — glowing violet veins faintly appear under the skin. While marked, they automatically fail the save against the Nightmare Curse until the corruption is cleansed (e.g., by _Greater Restoration_, _Remove Curse_, or sunlight purification).
