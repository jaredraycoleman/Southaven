## Twin Orbs of Passage

_Wondrous Item, Very Rare (requires attunement)_

Two flawless white crystal spheres rest upon golden pedestals shaped like outstretched wings. Faint motes of light swirl within each orb, mirroring the movements of its twin. Forged by planar wayfarers of ages past, the orbs are bound together by a tether of ancient translocation magic: to touch one is to leap instantly to the other.

Touching the orb causes you to instantly teleport to the location of its twin, along with any equipment you are carrying. The range is unlimited, so long as both orbs exist on the same plane of existence.
### Stability Check

The magic of the orbs is volatile, especially when separated by great distances or recently disturbed. When you activate an orb, roll a d20 and apply the appropriate modifiers:
- **Distance Penalty:** –1 for every 10 miles between the orbs.
- **Stabilization Bonus:** +1 for each full day the orbs have remained unmoved.
- **Scrying Bonus:** If you use _scrying_ (or the orbs are otherwise visible to you during activation), you gain a +5 bonus to the roll as the magic can “lock on” to the destination.

Consult the table below to determine the effect of the teleportation:

|d20 Result|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|**Catastrophic Failure.** The creature dies instantly as their essence is lost between points.|
|2–5|**Severe Misjump.** The creature appears at the destination poisoned for 24 hours, falls unconscious for 1 hour, and loses a limb (DM’s discretion).|
|6–9|**Major Misjump.** The creature appears poisoned for 24 hours, falls unconscious for 1 hour, and loses a finger or similar minor extremity.|
|10–13|**Moderate Misjump.** The creature falls unconscious for 1 hour and loses a finger or similar extremity.|
|14–17|**Rough Landing.** The creature is unconscious for 1 hour.|
|18–19|**Disorienting Arrival.** The creature is incapacitated for 1 minute.|
|20+|**Clean Transit.** The teleportation succeeds with no negative effects.|
