![[Alith Vaelrin_ef1b6fd4.webp]]
### Description

A young elven noble with a bright smile and restless energy, Alith had the look of someone always one step away from his next prank. He favored fine but rumpled clothes, often adorned with forest greens and autumn tones. Though his life was cut short, many remember his laughter lingering in the halls of House Vaelrin.

### Personality

Warm, loyal, and playful. Alith thrived on connection—especially the unexpected kind. His friendship with [[Garrin Dace]], a human, defied expectations in elven society, and he wore that rebellion like a badge. Mischievous but never cruel, Alith had a knack for making people feel included (especially those who didn’t quite belong).

### Background

The favored eldest son of House Vaelrin, Alith carried both noble expectations and a free spirit. He invited [[Garrin Dace]], his closest friend, to his sister's wedding despite disapproval from some relatives. During the celebration, a fire, caused by smuggled fireworks, took the lives of everyone in the manor, including Alith himself. His body was buried beneath the family crypt, along with a secret that only Garrin and his little sister [[Melissa Vaelrin]] would ever know.
