![[Archdruid Thalwen Myr_0aa563bf.webp]]
## Description

A towering elf draped in scorched green and copper robes, Thalwen carries herself like a storm held barely in check. Her long hair, silvered with age, hangs in thick braids threaded with dried herbs and ember-stones. Her staff is blackened oak, split and scarred from years of flamecraft. Her presence is commanding, her gaze unblinking, her voice low and hard like thunder in dry air.

## Personality

Thalwen is uncompromising, principled, and unafraid of confrontation. She believes fire is a sacred tool—not of destruction, but of restoration. Where others hesitate, she acts. Her trust is hard-won, her respect even harder. She speaks in absolutes, preferring truth over comfort and sacrifice over slow decay. To her, mercy is not inaction—it is clarity of purpose.
## Background

Thalwen has served [[The Circle of Verdant Flame]] for over three centuries. She survived the *Season of Ashes*, a great wildfire blamed on arcane meddling, which shaped her belief in preemptive action. She rose to prominence by leading the Burning Vigil, a controversial cleansing of corrupted groves decades ago. Her loyalty lies with the land, not with thrones or titles. The revelation of Queen Aelra's tampering with Faeren's groves ignites something in her: righteous fury. She sees the Queen's use of the *Ring of Verdant Stillness* as a betrayal, not just of the Circle, but of nature itself.
