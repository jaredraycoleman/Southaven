![[Baern Ironfist_6d762d2a.webp]]
## Description  

Baern Ironfist is the Captain of the City Watch, a grizzled dwarven veteran who has spent decades keeping the streets of Lusteris safe. Broad-shouldered and built like a fortress, his scarred face and iron-gray beard give him the look of a man who has seen it all—and lived to tell the tale. His watch uniform, though well-kept, is worn from years of service, battle, and late nights spent enforcing the law. His piercing dark eyes scan crowds with the instinct of a lifelong officer, always searching for trouble before it starts.  

## Personality  

Baern is pragmatic, duty-driven, and fiercely loyal to the people of Lusteris. He does not serve the nobility or the politicians—he serves the city itself. While he upholds the law, he is not blind to its flaws; justice matters more to him than rules, and he will bend regulations if it means protecting the innocent. Though rough-spoken and blunt, he has a deep well of compassion, particularly for the common folk who suffer under the city's corruption.  

## Background  

Baern was born into a long line of dwarven warriors, but rather than joining the Obsidian Army, he chose the City Watch, believing that protecting the streets of Lusteris mattered just as much as defending its borders. Over the years, he has battled smugglers, assassins, and street gangs, but the rise of crime guilds and [[Eirik Ravenskald]]'s stranglehold on the city's finances have made his job harder than ever.
