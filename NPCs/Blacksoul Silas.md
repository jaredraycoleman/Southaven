## Description

Blacksoul Silas is a gaunt, pale elf with an unsettling aura that seems to leech the warmth from the air. His hollow cheeks and sunken eyes, glowing faintly with crimson light, give him a skeletal, half-dead appearance. Silas wears long robes of black and deep crimson, embroidered with writhing symbols that seem to shift when viewed too long. His silver-white hair is slicked back from sharp, angular features, and a jagged scar cuts from his left eye to his jawline. In his hands he carries a staff crowned with a pulsing obsidian crystal, and at his throat gleams the emblem of the **Black Architect**.

## Personality

Cold, calculating, and ambitious to the point of obsession, Silas is a man who measures the world in schemes and sacrifices. His voice is silken, persuasive, yet every word carries venom. To him, people are tools: to be shaped, used, or broken as needed. His devotion to [[Taelkor|The Black Architect]] is absolute, but unlike many of his brethren, he hungers not just to _serve_, but to _shape_ the return.

%%  
Silas is consumed by prophecy. He interprets the "twin wings of ruin" as a command, believing two Starborn must rise when the Architect returns. To others, this is blasphemy or folly, but to Silas, it is destiny.

Silas is fanatically convinced the prophecy points to a second Starborn. Whether he seeks to create, discover, or become this "twin wing" is left open, but he sees [[Malrith Kelbirn, the Starborn|Malrith]] not as a master but as a partner or rival. This puts him at odds with other cult leaders, who either interpret "twin wings" as referring to Malrith's dragon or avoid the prophecy entirely. His ambition makes him dangerous but also vulnerable. His obsession could drive him to reckless alliances or betrayal.

## Background

The party first saw [[Blacksoul Silas]] in [[Session 7 - Infiltrating Duskwatch Keep]], when he was trying to convince [[Mira Fallbrook]] to join the cult in [[Duskwatch Keep]]. Since then, they have seen notes and mentions from him here and there, but are not sure what he is up to.

Once a promising mage in a prestigious elven enclave, Silas delved too deeply into forbidden texts and was exiled for his unquenchable hunger for knowledge. The whispers of the Order of the Black Star drew him in, where his cunning and ruthless intellect propelled him swiftly upward. He became a Blacksoul, rediscovering ancient rites of necromancy and reshaping them into the cult’s modern arsenal.
