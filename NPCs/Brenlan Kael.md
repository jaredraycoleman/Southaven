![[Brenlan Kael_4a1da16b.webp]]
## Description

Brenlan Kael is a young man of 17 years, possessing an unassuming charm. He is [[Lord Elrin Kael]]'s son and heir to the Lordship of [[Southaven]]. With tousled blonde hair that catches the light in vibrant shades of gold, his gentle blue eyes radiate curiosity and warmth. He has a lean build, typical of someone who spends more time in libraries and courts than in training grounds. His attire, often neat but slightly disheveled, consists of well-tailored tunics in shades of blue and green, reminiscent of his noble lineage.

## Personality

Brenlan is kind-hearted and introspective, occasionally overshadowed by the expectations that come with his noble birth. He often comes off as timid, especially when engaging with those who seem more adventurous or confident. Yet, beneath this exterior lies a spirited dreamer, one who is deeply fascinated by tales of heroism, magic, and the unknown. He is a good listener and has a knack for asking insightful questions, often leading others to share their stories about distant lands and epic battles. Brenlan tends to avoid confrontations and prefers to resolve conflicts peacefully, often seeking the advice of others before acting himself.

## Background

As the son of Lord Kael of Southaven, Brenlan enjoys a privileged life with access to education and resources. However, he often feels the weight of his family's legacy pressing down upon him. Raised in the lavish halls of Southaven's castle, he is expected to follow in his father's footsteps and take on responsibilities that come with nobility.

Despite this, Brenlan yearns for adventure and is often found hidden in the castle's library, captivated by tales of heroes and legends. His days are filled with study and dreams of the great world outside, where he imagines himself as part of the stories he so loves to read. He frequently dreams of joining adventurers on grand quests, but self-doubt often holds him back from taking bold steps toward that freedom.

The party met Brenlan in [[Session 3 - The Hag of Blacktide Swamp]] after defeating the hag. [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] gifted him a crocodile's tooth and he was very interested in their adventures. He became friendly with them and saw the party at [[Rusty's Tavern]] often. In [[Session 5 - The Kidnapping of Brenlan Kael]], Brenlan was kidnapped by [[Donavar Reddmark]] and the party saved him.
