## Description

Judge Caelthas Sunstrider is a tall, graceful high elf with long silver-white hair tied neatly behind him and amber eyes that gleam with quiet authority. He dresses in flowing robes of white and gold embroidered with delicate vinework, and a silver sunburst, the holy symbol of Elandria, rests upon his chest. His movements are precise and deliberate, every gesture carrying the weight of judgment.

## Personality

Caelthas is a stern but fair arbiter, a man who listens with patience and values truth above politics. Though his voice is calm, it can cut sharp when he senses deceit or disrespect. He holds tightly to the belief that justice must serve not only the letter of the law but also the compassion of Elandria's will. Beneath his composed exterior lies a quiet dread that corruption may yet seep into sacred institutions.

## Background

Born into a noble family of scholars, Caelthas chose faith over politics and devoted himself to the priesthood of Elandria. Over three centuries he has presided over disputes of every scale, from petty quarrels to judgments between nobles and druids, building a reputation for impartiality that commands respect throughout the Elfwood.
