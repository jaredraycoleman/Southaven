![[calenhir_sylvenblade.webp|273x273]]
## Description

Tall and angular, Calenhir Sylvenblade moves with the restrained grace of an old-world swordsman. His skin is pale gold, marked with fine silver tattoos that trace across his arms, throat, and brow in ancient elven script. His hair is long, bright, and streaked with ash from years at the forge. Scars and burn marks lace his hands and forearms, the badges of a smith who shapes metal with reverence and fury. He wears a sleeveless leather apron etched with warding glyphs.

## Personality

Calenhir is stoic, deliberate, and possessed of a deep, quiet intensity. He believes that action speaks more clearly than words, and that most things worth saying have already been said in song or steel. Grief has not broken him, but sharpened him. He no longer believes in fate, only in preparation. Still, a trace of the poet lingers in his tone when he speaks of crafting, memory, or his late wife.

He does not smile easily. But when he does, it is with surprising warmth, and then gone like smoke.

## Background

Once a soldier of [[Balandel]], Calenhir was trained in both warfare and high craftsmanship. He served as a smith for the Balandel Embassy Guard, crafting weapons for envoys and bladesingers alike. After stepping away from court life, he and his wife Laerwen, a healer of some renown, opened the [[Balandel#Shopping District|The Silver Bark Armory in Balandel's Shopping District]].

In [[Session 15 - Pies and Pestilence]], the party saved Calenhir and his daughter from [[Granny Louise]]. In [[Session 22 - Secrets, Sides, and Silent Blades]], they rescued them again from would-be assassins targetting [[Laerwen Sylvenblade]] for her prophetic visions.

One day, while working in the forge, a hooded, soft-spoken druid claiming to serve [[Circle of Verdant Flame]] walked in with quiet urgency. He claimed their daughter [[Laerwen Sylvenblade|Laerwen]] showed signs of rare foresight: visions, dreams, and whispers from the Wild Beyond. A _dreamer_, he called her, in the old tongue: one touched by fate, marked to carry prophecy.

He urged them to seek [[Granny Louise]], an elder known for gentle magic and insight into such gifts. The druid spoke with conviction, and something in his measured tone convinced them. This was all a setup to kill all those born in Balandel with prophetic gifts, though, as they are seen as dangerous by the [[Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star]].
