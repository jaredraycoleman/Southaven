## Description

Castellan Verin is an unremarkable man in his mid-forties with forgettable features—mousy brown hair, gray eyes, average build. He currently serves as the effective head of the [[Church of Elandria]] in [[Solaris]], managing church affairs in [[Luminarch Theodric Brightspire]]'s absence. He also serves as a close advisor to [[King Aldric IX Solborn]] on church matters. He wears simple gray robes and moves quietly through both the Cathedral and the Royal Palace with perfect efficiency.

## Personality

Verin is known to be humble, patient, and utterly devoted to serving the Church. He anticipates needs, handles problems discreetly, and never draws attention to himself. He speaks softly and deferentially, always appropriate and helpful. Those who work closely with him note his calming presence and wise counsel.

## Background

Verin worked as a Church scribe and assistant to minor clergy for twenty years before being "gifted" to Luminarch Theodric in 1262 by a wealthy Church patron. He came with excellent recommendations and served faithfully as the Luminarch's personal assistant for years.

When Theodric departed for [[Lusteris]] several months ago to investigate cult activity, he entrusted Verin with managing Church affairs in the capital. [[King Aldric IX Solborn]], as temporary head of the Church, relies heavily on Verin's counsel and administrative expertise. Verin has become one of the King's most trusted advisors during this crisis period.

**DM ONLY - THE TRUTH:**

**Real Identity:** Caelith Voidwhisper, high-ranking Black Star cultist (Blacksoul rank)

**Mission:** Destroy [[Kingdom of Solara]] from within by corrupting its leadership

**Original Plan (1262-1267):**
- Poisoned [[Luminarch Theodric Brightspire]] for 5 years
- Special incense during evening prayers caused paranoia, authoritarianism, memory issues
- Successfully drove wedge between Crown and Church
- Created tensions that weakened Solara's response to threats

**The Pivot (When Theodric Left):**
- Theodric's unexpected departure to [[Lusteris]] removed him from Verin's influence
- Verin saw opportunity: with Theodric gone, direct access to [[King Aldric IX Solborn]]
- Began poisoning Aldric using same methods
- King's position gives even better leverage for paralyzing kingdom

**Current Method:**
- Special incense during King's evening contemplation/prayers
- Compounds amplify paranoia, legacy obsession, irrational fears
- Psychological manipulation—convincing Aldric that [[Southaven]] plans secession
- Makes King see conspiracies everywhere, especially regarding Southaven
- Document forgery and information control
- Started shortly after Theodric's departure (several months ago)

**The Forgettability:**
- Partly natural, partly enhanced by subtle magic
- Makes him easy to overlook and difficult to investigate
- People don't remember him being present at important moments
- Allows him to move between Palace and Cathedral unnoticed

**True Personality:**
- Cold, calculating fanatic
- Devoted to [[Taelkor]]'s vision
- No pleasure in suffering—just sees it as necessary work
- Patient (spent 20 years building cover identity)
- Adaptable (pivoted from Theodric to Aldric seamlessly)
- Willing to die to complete mission

**The Revised Four-Phase Plan:**
1. ✓ Corrupt Theodric, drive wedge between Crown and Church (Complete)
2. ✓ Remove Theodric from play via Lusteris mission (Complete—unintentional but beneficial)
3. ⚙ Poison King Aldric, paralyze kingdom's response to crises (In Progress)
4. ⏳ Use Southaven siege to trigger Aldric's paranoia, prevent aid, let city fall (Preparing)
5. ⏳ Eventually expose corruption, destroy faith in both Crown and Church (Final)

**Specific Goals with Aldric:**
- Convince him Southaven is rebellious like [[Lusteris]]
- Prevent royal aid from reaching [[Lord Elrin Kael]]
- Use Southaven's fall to destabilize kingdom
- Make Aldric appear weak, mad, or tyrannical
- Ultimately destroy confidence in Solaran leadership

**Key Assets:**
- Journal in cult cipher documenting everything (hidden in quarters)
- Coded communications with other agents
- Direct access to King as "trusted advisor"
- Control of Church administration in Theodric's absence
- Backup identity in [[Lusteris]] for escape
- Poison to prevent interrogation if captured

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Incense is detectable by skilled alchemist (DC 17)
- Background has subtle inconsistencies if thoroughly investigated
- Hidden cult symbols in personal quarters
- Other cultists watching him (can be tracked)
- If Theodric returns, may expose the deception

**If Exposed:**
1. Deny everything
2. Call on King Aldric to defend him (King trusts him completely)
3. Accuse accusers of being Southaven separatists
4. Escape if possible
5. Take poison rather than be captured
6. Death triggers exposure protocol anyway

**Combat:** High-level rogue/assassin with cult magic items
