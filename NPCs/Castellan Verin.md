## Description

Castellan Verin is an unremarkable man in his mid-forties with forgettable features—mousy brown hair, gray eyes, average build. He serves as personal assistant to [[Luminarch Theodric Brightspire]], wearing simple gray robes and moving quietly through the Cathedral. He handles the Luminarch's correspondence, schedule, and private chambers with perfect efficiency.

## Personality

Verin is known to be humble, patient, and utterly devoted to serving [[Luminarch Theodric Brightspire]]. He anticipates needs, handles problems discreetly, and never draws attention to himself. He speaks softly and deferentially, always appropriate and helpful. Those who interact with him often feel better afterward—he has a talent for making people feel understood and important.

## Background

Verin worked as a Church scribe and assistant to minor clergy for twenty years before being "gifted" to Luminarch Theodric in 1262 by a wealthy Church patron. He came with excellent recommendations and has served faithfully ever since, becoming indispensable to the Luminarch's daily routine.

**DM ONLY - THE TRUTH:**

**Real Identity:** Caelith Voidwhisper, high-ranking Black Star cultist (Blacksoul rank)

**Mission:** Destroy [[Kingdom of Solara]] from within by corrupting its religious leadership

**Method:** 
- Special incense during Theodric's evening prayers contains alchemical poison
- Compounds cause paranoia, authoritarianism, memory issues
- Psychological manipulation amplifies Theodric's existing beliefs to extremes
- Document forgery and information control
- 5 years of gradual corruption (1262-1267)

**The Forgettability:** 
- Partly natural, partly enhanced by subtle magic
- Makes him easy to overlook and difficult to investigate
- People don't remember him being present at important moments

**True Personality:**
- Cold, calculating fanatic
- Devoted to [[Taelkor]]'s vision
- No pleasure in suffering—just sees it as necessary work
- Patient (spent 20 years building cover identity)
- Willing to die to complete mission

**The Four-Phase Plan:**
1. ✓ Drive wedge between Crown and Church (Complete)
2. ⚙ Use Southaven crisis to paralyze leadership (In Progress)
3. ⏳ Push Theodric to demand inquisitorial powers, spark civil war (Preparing)
4. ⏳ Expose Theodric's corruption publicly, destroy Church credibility (Final)

**Key Assets:**
- Journal in cult cipher documenting everything (hidden in quarters)
- Coded communications with other agents
- Backup identity in [[Lusteris]] for escape
- Poison to prevent interrogation if captured

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Incense is detectable by skilled alchemist (DC 17)
- Background has subtle inconsistencies if thoroughly investigated
- Hidden cult symbols in personal quarters
- Other cultists watching him (can be tracked)

**If Exposed:**
1. Deny everything
2. Call on Theodric to defend him
3. Escape if possible
4. Take poison rather than be captured
5. Death triggers exposure protocol anyway

**Combat:** High-level rogue/assassin with cult magic items
