## Description

Castellan Verin is an unremarkable man in his mid-forties with forgettable features—mousy brown hair, gray eyes, average build. He currently serves as the effective head of the [[Church of Elandria]] in [[Solaris]], managing church affairs in [[Luminarch Theodric Brightspire]]'s absence. He also serves as a close advisor to [[King Aldric IX Solborn]] on church matters. He wears simple gray robes and moves quietly through both the Cathedral and the Royal Palace with perfect efficiency.

## Personality

Verin is known to be humble, patient, and utterly devoted to serving the Church. He anticipates needs, handles problems discreetly, and never draws attention to himself. He speaks softly and deferentially, always appropriate and helpful. Those who work closely with him note his calming presence and wise counsel.

## Background

Verin worked as a Church scribe and assistant to minor clergy for twenty years before being "gifted" to Luminarch Theodric in 1262 by a wealthy Church patron. He came with excellent recommendations and served faithfully as the Luminarch's personal assistant for years.

When Theodric departed for [[Lusteris]] several months ago to investigate cult activity, he entrusted Verin with managing Church affairs in the capital. [[King Aldric IX Solborn]], as temporary head of the Church, relies heavily on Verin's counsel and administrative expertise. Verin has become one of the King's most trusted advisors during this crisis period.
