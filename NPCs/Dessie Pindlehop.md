![[Dessie Pindlehop_e21ff953.webp]]

Dessie Pindlehop is a halfling who was saved from cultists by the party in [[Session 14 - Oaths in the Wild]]. The party does not know, though, that the cultists had already killed and reanimated her. She is extremely life-like, but can be detected as undead by spells like Detect Good or Evil. She acts normally, but will obey any commands upon hearing her trigger phrase "the architect is calling you to serve."
