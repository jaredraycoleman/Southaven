## Description

Donavar Reddmark is a skilled shapeshifter. He most often takes the form a strikingly handsome human in his early 40s, his city-sleek features a testament to years of living dangerously amidst the shadows. With a well-groomed beard and dark, swept-back hair peppered with silver, he exudes an aura of confidence and authority. His piercing green eyes are sharp and calculating, holding a glint of malice that reveals the ruthlessness lurking beneath his charming facade. Typically clad in finely tailored clothing adorned with subtle emblems of his guild, he knows how to command attention while remaining inconspicuous when necessary.

He sometimes takes the form of a blonde or brown haired man with different eye colors but always maintains the same sharp features and aura of authority. His true form is that of a homely, unassuming middle-aged man.

## Personality

Smug and cocky, Donavar revels in the power and wealth he has amassed through his extensive smuggling operations. Unlike many who turn to illegal activities for survival, he thrives in the chaos, finding pleasure in outwitting rivals and manipulating clients. His charisma and silver tongue make him a master negotiator, able to seal deals that others would balk at. Yet, he has little regard for the morality of his actions, viewing life as a game to be played to win.

Donavar's loyalty is primarily to himself, and he is prone to betrayal if it serves his interests. His charming demeanor hides an unyielding ruthlessness; he isn't afraid to eliminate anyone who threatens his position. He takes great pride in mocking rivals and will use any means necessary to maintain his control over the most vital smuggling routes and clientele, particularly the [Black Star cultists](Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Star.md).

## Background

Born to a modest family in a bustling city, Donavar's childhood was marked by hardship, but he quickly learned how to manipulate situations to his advantage. By the age of 20, he had risen through the ranks of various illicit trades, establishing himself as a key player in the underworld. He founded the [Duskrunners](The%20Duskrunners.md) as a means of consolidating power and influence, recruiting a loyal crew of ruthless bandits who share his zest for crime.

Driven by ambition, Donavar has spent years battling rival guilds like **The Black Thorns**. These conflicts have forged a dark reputation for him—both a cunning strategist and a formidable foe. Each victory only feeds his insatiable hunger for control, and he dreams of establishing a dominion over all illegal trade within the region.
