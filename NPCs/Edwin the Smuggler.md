## Description

Edwin is a wiry, quick-moving man in his thirties with the perpetually watchful eyes of someone who's made a career of not getting caught. He dresses in nondescript, practical clothing that helps him blend into crowds—dark colors, multiple hidden pockets, and boots made for running rather than fashion.

His face is unremarkable by design, the kind of face that people forget quickly. A thin scar on his left cheek is the only distinguishing feature he hasn't been able to erase. He speaks quickly and moves even quicker, always seeming ready to bolt at the first sign of trouble.

## Personality

Edwin is a coward and a liar who prioritizes his own survival above any contract or moral consideration. He's good at what he does—smuggling people and goods past checkpoints and blockades—but only when the risk is manageable. When things go wrong, he abandons his clients without hesitation.

He's charismatic enough to convince desperate people to trust him, and he's skilled at making excuses and spinning convincing lies. He doesn't think of himself as evil, just practical—everyone's trying to survive, and he's just better at it than most.

Edwin has no loyalty to anyone but himself. He'll work for whoever pays, and he'll betray them just as quickly if it means saving his own skin.

## Background

Edwin grew up in the slums of [[Solaris]] and learned early that survival meant being faster, smarter, and more ruthless than everyone else. He started as a petty thief and messenger boy before discovering he had a talent for moving contraband through the city's underground tunnels and secret passages.

Over the years, he built a reputation as a reliable smuggler—reliable in the sense that he usually got the job done, not that he was trustworthy. When the siege began, Edwin saw opportunity. Desperate nobles and wealthy merchants would pay handsomely for a way out.

[[Elen Tywin]] contacted him through intermediaries, and Edwin negotiated a substantial fee to smuggle her and her daughter [[Vanessa Tywin]] out of Southaven and to [[Lusteris]]. He knew the route through [[Blacktide Swamp]] was dangerous, but the money was too good to pass up.

When they encountered cultists in the swamp, Edwin made a split-second decision: save himself. He fled, leaving the Tywins to be captured. He then returned to Southaven and claimed he'd successfully delivered them to safety, collecting the second half of his payment from the Tywin estate servants who had no way to verify his story.

## Current Situation

Edwin is back in Southaven, laying low and spending the blood money he earned from betraying the Tywins. He's telling anyone who asks that he heroically got the nobles to safety despite the dangers. He's planning his next move—whether to wait out the siege or make another escape attempt with someone else's money.

If confronted by the party, he'll lie convincingly until presented with undeniable proof, then try to run.
