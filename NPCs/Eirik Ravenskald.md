## Description

Eirik Ravenskald is a broad, heavyset man whose presence fills any room—both physically and with his booming, self-satisfied laughter. His red-blonde hair is slicked back with meticulous care, and his face, perpetually flushed and smug, wears the sort of grin that suggests he’s already won an argument no one else knew was happening. He dresses in opulent green-and-gold suits tailored to accentuate his wealth rather than flatter his frame, and he carries himself with the swagger of a man convinced the world bends to his will. Behind him, the clinking of coins and the glint of gold are never far away—a constant reminder of the fortune he guards with greedy pride.

## Personality

Eirik is pompous, loud, and convinced of his own genius—though his ideas are rarely as clever as he believes. He loves the sound of his own voice and tends to mistake verbosity for intelligence. His arrogance borders on comedic; he often dismisses genuine experts, preferring to trust his “gut instinct,” which he claims has never failed him (though history suggests otherwise). Still, his sheer confidence and ability to bluff his way through situations make him oddly effective. Those who deal with him frequently oscillate between irritation and begrudging amusement at how someone so transparently self-serving can continue to rise.

## Background

Once a bloated real estate speculator with a knack for manipulating loopholes, Eirik’s wealth was built on inflated promises and conveniently reinterpreted contracts. He clawed his way into politics under the banner of “fiscal reform,” positioning himself as a savior of the city’s finances. In practice, this meant cutting aid programs, consolidating power in the Emerald Bank, and ensuring that every crisis somehow ended with him richer. Though his public speeches paint him as a benevolent steward of the people’s money, those who know him understand that his truest devotion lies with gold—his only unshakable faith.

## Story

Eirik Ravenskald’s downfall came as dramatically as his rise. His arrogance finally outpaced his cunning when his schemes began collapsing under their own weight. Exposed for embezzlement and treason, he met his end in [[Session 18 - A Flower for the Dead]], defiant to the last—still insisting, even as the verdict was read, that everyone else was simply too stupid to understand his brilliance.
