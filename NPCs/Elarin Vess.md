![[Elarin Vess_4120f773.webp]]
## Description

His dark auburn hair always seems faintly singed at the edges, no matter how carefully he keeps it trimmed. His golden-brown eyes catch the light like embers, glowing warm when he is deep in concentration. His student’s robes are plain and often soot-stained from long hours in the practice halls, the marks of diligence worn as naturally as any emblem. He carries himself with quiet intensity, as though he were always listening for the whisper of flame.

## Personality

Elarin is earnest and disciplined, with a natural reverence for fire and its lessons. He is dependable, a steady presence among his peers, though his dutiful nature sometimes makes him seem overly cautious. Politics and intrigue pass unnoticed by him—he is loyal to the Grove, to his teachers, and to the brotherhood of students who risk themselves daily in practice. He approaches each trial with humility rather than arrogance, never seeking to outshine, only to improve.

## Background

Elarin believes his mother sent him to the Grove of Fire because of his rare gift with flame. To him, it was a chance to train among those who truly understood the dangerous beauty of fire. In truth, the Queen herself arranged his placement, urging his mother to yield him to the Grove. For centuries, the order has resisted royal authority, and Elarin is meant to be the quiet foothold the Crown has long sought. He does not yet know he has been made a pawn in this larger game.
