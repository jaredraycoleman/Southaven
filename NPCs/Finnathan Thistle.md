## Description  

Finnathan "Finn" Thistle is a distinguished halfling professor of Divination at the Marble Academy. He is always impeccably dressed in finely tailored robes of deep blue and silver, the traditional colors of his field. His neatly combed salt-and-pepper curls frame sharp hazel eyes that seem to assess the future as much as the present. Though his stature is modest, his presence commands respect, and his voice—calm, measured, and articulate—carries the authority of a seasoned academic.  

## Personality  

Finn is a scholar who values rational thought, precision, and the pursuit of truth. He rejects fatalism, believing that divination is a tool for understanding possibilities, not dictating fate. A natural teacher, he is both patient and demanding, expecting intellectual rigor from his students. Though he presents himself as composed and methodical, he is not without conviction—he firmly believes in justice, education, and progress, making him a quiet but unwavering supporter of the Reformist movement.  

## Background  

Born into a respected family of scholars, Finn was admitted to the Marble Academy at a young age, quickly distinguishing himself in the study of foresight and arcane theory. His marriage to [[Tilly Thistle]], the Academy's Dean and Professor of Arcane Studies, cemented their shared commitment to education and reform. Together, they have worked to modernize the institution, challenging outdated traditions and advocating for accessibility in magical education. As tensions in Lusteris rise, Finn's measured defiance of the Traditionalist faction has made him a target of political intrigue, forcing him to balance his academic responsibilities with the growing threat against his ideals.
