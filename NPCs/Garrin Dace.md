![[Garrin Dace_644f7ab6.webp]]
## Description

A human man in his early thirties with tired eyes and a perpetually tense jaw, Garrin works at the Scarlet Shield Tavern. He wears simple clothes and rarely makes eye contact. Though friendly enough, there’s a shadow behind every smile and a weight to his silence when talk turns to the past.

## Personality

Earnest, anxious, and self-punishing. Garrin is desperate to make things right but paralyzed by fear of being exposed. He’s good-hearted but wracked with guilt, and constantly second-guesses his choices. His cowardice is rooted in shame, not selfishness.

### Background

Once a troublemaking teen from the lower city, Garrin befriended [[Alith Vaelrin]]—a bond few understood. Invited to the Vaelrin estate for a wedding, Garrin brought illegal fireworks as a joke. They were poorly made and unstable. When they exploded, they killed everyone present. Garrin fled and never told anyone. Melissa saw him that night. Now, years later, the past has come for him, and he may not survive the reckoning.
