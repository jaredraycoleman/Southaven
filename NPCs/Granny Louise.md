## Description

A plump, rosy-cheeked woman wrapped in a floral shawl and floury apron, Granny Louise exudes old-fashioned comfort. Her silver bun is pinned with pearwood combs, and her fingers are stained with jam and ink. Her home smells of cinnamon, clay, and stewed fruit. She smiles easily and speaks gently, like steam curling off warm custard.

But look closer: her eyes no longer reflect light quite right. Her skin feels oddly cool. Her laugh sometimes comes a second too late.

## Personality

Louise _believes_ she's still alive, still baking pies, tending her glade, and helping travelers with magic and advice. She hums, tidies compulsively, and offers kindness without hesitation. But something deep within her is broken and buried. Her soul is gone. What remains is habit, charm, and a hidden kill command.

## Background

Once a beloved pie witch of the [[Guild of the Wandering Flame]], Granny Louise was murdered by **Black Star cultists**. Her soul was destroyed, but her body was reanimated using the same false-soul technique employed on [[Dessie Pindlehop]].

Now, she functions like the woman she was. She bakes, she sings, she offers refuge. But beneath the surface, something listens. Watches. Waits.

Any mention of _divination_, _prophecy_, or attempts to peer into the future activates the kill-program buried deep in her mind. This is a mental tripwire, set to respond to the very idea of foresight. When the topic arises in her presence, even in passing, something inside her snaps.

Her warmth vanishes. Her eyes go flat and cold. Without warning or hesitation, she strikes swift, silent, and without mercy. In these moments, Louise doesn't recognize friends or allies. She becomes something else entirely: a precise, pre-programmed weapon whose only directive is eliminate the seer.

## Story

In [[Session 14 - Oaths in the Wild]], the party ran into Granny Louise on their way to Vael'Telor and trusted her after she mentioned being [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe]]'s friend. After [[Lirielle]] mentioned being a Diviner, she became hostile, poisoned the pies, and attacked the party. The party killed her and found two people, Calenhir Sylvenblade (owner of the Silver Bark Armory in [[Balandel#Shopping District|Balandel's Shopping District]]) and his daughter in cages in a secret room.
