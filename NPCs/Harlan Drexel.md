## Description

Harlan Drexel is a rugged and broad-shouldered blacksmith with calloused hands and a weathered face that speaks of years spent at the forge. His dark brown hair is streaked with gray, and his piercing blue eyes reveal a deep-seated determination and a hint of sorrow. Harlan typically wears a simple leather apron over a linen shirt and sturdy boots. He is often seen with a hammer at his side, a symbol of both his trade and his strength.

Despite his rough exterior, Harlan carries himself with a quiet dignity, and his voice has a gravelly tone that carries weight when he speaks. A simple silver chain with a small locket rests around his neck, hidden beneath his shirt. The locket contains a portrait of his wife and his newborn son, who are his greatest treasures.

## Personality

Harlan is a stoic and hardworking man who values family above all else. Though reserved, he is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and unafraid to stand up for what is right. He is a man of few words, preferring to let his actions speak for him, but when he does speak, his words are thoughtful and measured.

Beneath his stoicism lies a tender heart. Harlan's recent loss of his infant son to the cultists has left him haunted, and he struggles with guilt for being unable to protect his family. This grief fuels his determination to see justice served and his son returned safely. He harbors a deep-seated anger toward those who took his child, which can lead him to act recklessly when pushed too far.


## Background

Harlan was born and raised in Southaven, where he apprenticed under his father, a skilled blacksmith. Over the years, he built a reputation for crafting weapons and tools of exceptional quality, earning the respect of the town's people. He met his wife, Elara, a healer, at a local festival, and the two quickly fell in love. Together, they built a modest but happy life in Southaven.

Their joy was multiplied with the birth of their son, Ewan, a healthy baby boy with his mother's golden hair. However, their happiness was shattered when Ewan was taken by the cultists for reasons unknown.
