## Description

Irielle Duskwhisper is the picture of grace and empathy—her voice a whisper beneath stars, her movements more gliding than walking. Her long silvery-black hair is streaked with luminous strands of moonvine, and her dark robes carry the scent of dusk blooms and burned myrrh. Most see her as the Circle's emissary of compassion, a gentle counterbalance to Serelion's gravity.

But her smile masks rot. The original Irielle died in a sacred pool beneath Shael'Nareth, her blood offered in silence. Her impostor, a Blacksoul Adept named **Vaelith**, took her role with uncanny precision. She excels at deception not through lies, but by channeling her victims' emotions—mirroring their fears, hopes, and memories like a flawless actor.

## Personality

Irielle is subtle and hypnotic, weaving spiritual platitudes with eerie clarity. She speaks often of dreams, of death not as loss but as passage. Her conversations trail off like fog—never ending, always circling.

She rarely shows anger, but when pressed, her serenity becomes suffocating. She is the cult's emotional manipulator, coaxing doubt and despair into those around her like a slow toxin. Her loyalty to the Black Star is emotional as much as theological; she believes the current world is a cage of illusions—and only through death can truth be seen.

## Background

Vaelith was once a dreamreader in the ruins beneath the Deadlands, interpreting visions for the cult's oracles. Her transformation into Irielle was achieved through ritual skinbinding and memory transfusion—a horrific rite that granted her knowledge of Irielle's voice, habits, and even scent. She is now a voice for the cult in Balandel.
