## Description 

Ithilwen Galandel is the High Priestess of the Sapphire Temple and a devoted servant of Elandria, Goddess of Light. A striking elven woman with an ethereal presence, she moves with grace and quiet authority, her every step deliberate and serene. Her silver-white hair cascades down her back, framing luminous blue eyes that radiate wisdom and patience. She wears flowing robes of pale gold and deep sapphire, embroidered with sunburst motifs, the sacred symbol of her faith.  

## Personality  

Ithilwen is calm, compassionate, and deeply spiritual, always seeking to guide others through wisdom rather than force. Though a Traditionalist, she does not concern herself with noble power, believing instead that faith, healing, and moral guidance should lead the people of Lusteris. She values diplomacy and understanding, often acting as a mediator in political disputes. While she disapproves of the Reformists' disruption, she recognizes their good intentions and believes they should focus on spiritual growth rather than political struggle.  

## Background  

Born into an ancient elven lineage, Ithilwen dedicated herself to Elandria's teachings from a young age, rising within the Sapphire Temple through her wisdom and unwavering devotion. As High Priestess, she has sought to preserve peace and balance, though recent unrest in Lusteris has put her at odds with both Traditionalists and Reformists alike. She distrusts the growing corruption among the nobility but fears that radical change will lead to greater suffering. When tensions reach their breaking point, Ithilwen will be forced to decide whether to stand firm in neutrality or take a side before it's too late.
