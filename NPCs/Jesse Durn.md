![[Jesse Durn_fabdb960.webp]]

Jesse Durn is all quick movements and easy smiles, his sharp eyes constantly scanning for opportunity. His tousled brown hair falls messily over his forehead, making him look younger than he is. His lean frame allows him to dart through crowds with practiced agility, and his ever-present grin gives the impression that he's never taken life too seriously—even when he probably should.  

He dresses in loose, comfortable clothing, favoring a well-worn vest and an array of knives strapped across his belt. His fingers never seem to stop moving, constantly flicking a coin, a dagger, or some trinket he's pilfered just for the thrill of it.
