![[Kaelen Rynn_0a72b868.webp]]

Kaelen Rynn is a towering figure of hardened muscle, a warrior built for battle. His once-noble features are now weathered by scars, his dark beard framing a face that has seen too many fights. His long, unruly hair is streaked with silver, making him appear older than he is. His armor is dented and worn, a stark contrast to the finely made sword he carries—a reminder of the life he lost.  

He speaks rarely, but when he does, his voice carries weight. There is no arrogance in him, no need to prove himself with words. He lets his strength speak for itself. His piercing gaze is both watchful and weary, as if searching for something he can never quite find.
