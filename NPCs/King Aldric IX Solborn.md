## Description

King Aldric IX Solborn is a man in his early sixties with silvered hair that was once golden. He has the traditional blue eyes of the Solborn line and carries himself with practiced regal bearing, though close observers notice the weight of his crown growing heavier each year. He dresses in white and gold, with Elandria's sunburst embroidered on his breast, and wears the Ring of Solborn—a signet passed down through every monarch since the kingdom's founding.

Unlike the warrior-kings of old, Aldric is more administrator than soldier, with soft hands and a careful, measured way of moving.

## Personality

King Aldric is a pragmatic ruler who prefers negotiation to warfare and compromise to confrontation. He is intelligent and politically astute, thinking several moves ahead before making decisions. Some see this as wisdom; others see it as indecisiveness.

In recent months, however, he has become increasingly paranoid and obsessed with his legacy. He speaks often of threats to the kingdom's unity and questions the loyalty of those around him. Court whispers note he has grown weary, drinks more wine than he once did, and seems almost... diminished in judgment.

## Background

Born in 1205 as the third son of King Marcus IV, Aldric never expected to inherit the throne. When plague killed his older brothers in 1235, he suddenly became heir at age thirty. [[Luminarch Theodric Brightspire]] personally mentored him for sixteen years before his coronation in 1251.

His reign has been marked by stability and prosperity, though tragedy struck in 1257 when his son and heir died in a riding accident. His wife, Queen Elendra, died in 1264, leaving his daughter Princess Mariella (who married and moved to [[Sunset Bluff]]) as his only surviving child. He has not remarried despite pressure to produce more heirs.

With [[Luminarch Theodric Brightspire]] away on a mission to [[Lusteris]] for the past several months, Aldric has assumed temporary leadership of the [[Church of Elandria]] in [[Solaris]]. He delegated most church administrative matters to [[Castellan Verin]], who serves as effective head of the Church in the Luminarch's absence. The [[Order of the Black Star]]'s Siege of Southaven represents the greatest crisis of his reign.

**DM ONLY - THE KING'S SITUATION:**

**The Truth:**
- King Aldric is being poisoned by [[Castellan Verin]], a Black Star cultist
- The poisoning has made him paranoid, obsessed with his legacy, and increasingly irrational
- Believes [[Southaven]] is following [[Lusteris]]'s path and plans to secede from [[Kingdom of Solara]]
- Extremely skeptical of offers of help—sees conspiracies everywhere
- Spends considerable time with Verin, who "helps" with Church matters

**The Corruption:**
- Similar method to what Verin used on Theodric (special incense, alchemical compounds)
- Amplifies Aldric's fears about his legacy and the kingdom's future
- Makes him suspicious of Lord Kael, Southaven, and anyone connected to them
- Impairs his judgment while leaving him seemingly functional
- Started after Theodric left for [[Lusteris]] (Verin gained direct access)

**Current State:**
- Obsessively worried about being remembered as the king who lost the kingdom
- Convinced Southaven's independence movements mirror Lusteris's republicanism
- Suspicious that aid requests from Southaven are cover for sedition
- Drinks heavily, paces at night, trusts almost no one except Verin
- Makes erratic decisions that undermine his own interests

**Verin's Position:**
- With Theodric gone, Verin has direct access to the King
- Serves as "advisor" on Church matters in Theodric's absence
- Poisoning Aldric is part of the broader plan to paralyze Solara
- King's paranoia prevents effective response to Southaven crisis

**Personal Struggles:**
- Knows he needs heir but can't bring himself to remarry
- Genuinely cares for Theodric (who mentored him) but hasn't heard from him in months
- Deep down, fears he's going mad but won't admit it
- Legacy obsession stems from real insecurity about his reign

**What He Needs:**
- Removal from Verin's influence
- Medical detoxification (similar to Theodric)
- Evidence that Southaven is loyal (not planning secession)
- Trusted allies who aren't compromised
- Path forward that preserves his legacy

**If Party Helps Him:**
- Can offer significant rewards (titles, lands, gold)
- Powerful ally for future
- Access to royal resources
- Information about cult operations
- But first they must get through his paranoia and suspicion
