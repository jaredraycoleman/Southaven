## Description  

King Brundrik Stonebluff of the [[Ember Halls]] is a broad-shouldered, thick-bearded dwarf in his early 200s, with iron-grey hair streaked with rust-red and deep-set eyes like dark amber. His armor is practical but beautifully worked—a mix of old ceremonial plate and newer reforged pieces. His crown is a modest circlet of black iron and mithril, styled like a broken mountain ridge. He carries himself like a warrior first and a king second, with the weight of duty clearly etched into the lines of his face.
## Personality  

Blunt, gruff, and grounded, Brundrik is a king of action more than pageantry. He speaks plainly, expects competence, and values deeds over titles. Beneath his hardened demeanor is a deep loyalty to his people and a heavy sense of responsibility. He carries the burdens of the throne with quiet resolve and drinks to dull the memory of every life lost under his reign. While slow to trust outsiders, he is capable of great warmth and generosity to those who prove themselves allies of Khur Dural.
## Background  

Born to the Stonebluff clan, Brundrik was never meant to rule. He served in the Iron Tunnels Guard for decades, rising through ranks not by blood but valor. When a plague and a series of cave-ins wiped out the royal line, Brundrik was elevated by the council—reluctantly, but unanimously. He's spent the last fifty years holding Khur Dural together through economic strain, goblin incursions, and now, something far darker. With the deep tunnels collapsing and old enemies stirring, Brundrik finds himself fighting a war no army ever prepared for.
