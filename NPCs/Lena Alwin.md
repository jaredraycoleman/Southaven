## Description

Lena Alwin is a warm-hearted woman in her late twenties with gentle features and kind eyes. Her brown hair is usually tied back in a practical braid, and she dresses simply in the sturdy clothing of a Southaven shopkeeper. She works at [[Rusty's Tavern]] in [[Southaven]] and is known throughout the town for her generosity and kindness, often extending credit to struggling families or "accidentally" over-serving those in need (which [[Rusty Ironbelly]] turns a blind eye to).

## Personality

Lena is compassionate, optimistic, and sees the good in people—sometimes to a fault. She believes in second chances and redemption, which is part of what drew her to [[Gareth Voss]], her boyfriend, despite his troubled past with [[Duskrunners]].

## Background

Lena grew up in [[Southaven]], the daughter of shopkeepers who taught her the value of community and compassion. She met [[Gareth Voss]] when the two were teenagers and she started working at [[Rusty's Tavern]]. Despite warnings from others about his history with [[Duskrunners]], Lena saw something genuine in Gareth. She gave him a chance, and they gradually fell in love. Her faith in him helped him stay on the straight path, even when temptation arose.
