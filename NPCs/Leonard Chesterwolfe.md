Leonard Chesterwolfe is a wolf first encountered by the party during the [[Session 1 - The Disappearances in Southaven]]. Drawn to [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]], he quickly became her loyal companion, fighting at her side through ambushes, cultist lairs, and many other dangers.

In [[Session 10 - Flight and Revelation]], Leonard was left behind amid the chaos of [[Malrith Kelbirn, the Starborn]]'s dark ritual. He was mourned greatly by the party. However, hope returned in [[Session 19 - The Verdant Reliquary]] when a message from [[Lyrian Brightwind]] revealed that Leonard had survived and been found.

Leonard was resurrected by [[Malrith Kelbirn, the Starborn|Malrith]] himself and given new dark power. After seeing him alive at a rally, [[Lyrian Brightwind|Lyrian]] came up with a plan to rescue him. His plan went off without a hitch, and he brought a sedated Leonard back to his rebel's headquarters. He soon found out that Leonard had changed, though. He was aggressive toward the rebels and they have to keep him in a cage. The rebel's druid, Laryssa Everbloom, has spoken with Leonard but he is consumed by rage and repeats only that he must obey the will of his true master.
