![[Lorand-6908e831.webp]]
## Description

Lorand is a lean, wiry man in his early thirties with sharp, angular features that suggest a life lived in shadows. His dark hair is kept short and practical, and his piercing gray eyes constantly scan his surroundings with calculated wariness. He moves with the quiet grace of a predator, each gesture precise and economical. His clothing is dark and nondescript—designed to blend into crowds or disappear into darkness—though keen observers might notice the quality of his well-maintained leather armor and the multiple concealed weapons he carries.

A thin scar runs along his jawline, and his calloused hands speak to years of deadly work.

## Personality

Lorand is cunning and pragmatic, valuing his own survival above all else. He speaks with a careful, measured tone, revealing only what serves his purposes and always keeping his true intentions hidden. While he can be charming when it suits him, there's a coldness beneath the surface—a willingness to do whatever is necessary without moral hesitation.

He's patient and strategic, preferring to wait for the perfect moment rather than act rashly. Lorand holds grudges quietly and repays debts—both positive and negative—with meticulous care. He respects strength and competence, but loyalty is a currency he only pretends to understand.

## Background

Lorand works as an assassin for the cult that has been operating in and around [[Southaven]]. He was captured by the party in [[Session 26 - The Cultist Hideout]] after attempting to kill [[Landor Vess]] at the Windcrest Inn. Recognizing that direct confrontation would mean his death, Lorand negotiated a deal: he would lead the party to the cultist hideout in exchange for his freedom and 10 gold.

During the journey to the hideout, [[Lirielle]] detected traps on the road ahead. Lorand claimed he had planned to warn them, though his sincerity was questionable. When the party heard the explosion inside the cave and rushed in to save [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]], Lirielle attempted to convince Lorand to help them in the fight, but he refused. True to their agreement, he left as they had promised.

Lorand will eventually return to betray the party. He views his release as a tactical retreat, not an act of mercy, and he will use the information he's gathered about the party to strike when they least expect it. His pride was wounded by his capture, and he intends to settle the score—preferably when the odds are heavily in his favor.

He remains loyal to the cult and their mysterious goals, though his loyalty is primarily driven by profit and the protection the organization provides rather than true belief in their cause.
