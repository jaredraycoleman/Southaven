![[Lord Elric Kael.webp]]

Lord Elric is [[Lord Elrin Kael]]'s cousin and lord of [[Seawatch]], the coastal elite city of the kingdom of Solara.
## Description

Lord Elric is the cousin of [[Lord Elrin Kael]] and the current lord of [[Seawatch]], the jewel of the Solaran coast. He dresses in flamboyant silks and jewels that sparkle brighter than the surf, and he carries himself with the air of someone who believes the world should stop when he enters a room. Tall and broad-shouldered, with meticulously styled hair and a practiced smile, Elric strives to embody the ideal of nobility—even if it often tips into parody. His voice carries across a hall, equal parts charm and condescension.
## Personality

Arrogant and sharp-tongued, Lord Elric delights in making others feel small. He relishes reminding his cousin and peers that Seawatch eclipses their provincial holdings. Witty and cutting, his barbs are laced with just enough truth to sting. While many find him insufferable, his energy and flair for spectacle make him difficult to ignore.

What makes Elric truly complex is that he knows his wife is unfaithful—and with a servant boy no less. Rather than confront the betrayal directly, he treats it as beneath him, a petty insult unworthy of acknowledgment. To others, he pretends indifference, but behind his bravado he is wounded and bitter. His arrogance often masks deep insecurity, and those perceptive enough may notice cracks in his polished mask when the subject of loyalty or family arises.

## Background

Lord Elric inherited [[Seawatch]] young and quickly molded it into a hub of excess and sophistication. Its bustling harbors, elite academies, and thriving merchant quarters are his pride, and he makes certain everyone knows that [[Seawatch]] outshines his cousin's territory.

His marriage, once politically advantageous, has become the scandalous backdrop to his reign. Though he guards the secret tightly, whispers drift through the servants’ halls and noble courts alike. The knowledge gnaws at him, fueling his need to constantly assert dominance and control elsewhere. Whether his unchecked pride will shield him from disgrace or set the stage for his downfall remains to be seen.
