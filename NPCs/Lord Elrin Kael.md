![[Lord Elrin Kael_9c7cd833.webp]]
## Description  

Lord Kael is a middle-aged nobleman with a commanding presence and an air of quiet authority. His sharp, angular features are framed by silver hair, and his piercing eyes seem to miss nothing. He dresses in fine, practical attire that balances his noble status with his hands-on approach to leadership. A signet ring bearing the crest of Southaven rests prominently on his finger.

## Personality  

Kael is pragmatic and duty-driven, fiercely loyal to the people of Southaven. He values intellect and decisive action, rewarding those who demonstrate competence. Though approachable and diplomatic, he harbors a deep mistrust of outsiders, a trait born from years of political intrigue and betrayal. Despite this, he is willing to trust adventurers when the stakes are high.

## Background  

Born into the Kael lineage, a family that has governed Southaven for generations, Kael inherited leadership at a young age after his father's untimely death. Under his stewardship, the town has prospered, though he has faced challenges such as banditry and dwindling resources from the mines. Kael's recent struggles with the townsfolk's mysterious disappearances have weighed heavily on him, forcing him to turn to unconventional solutions - like hiring adventurers.

## Story

In [[Session 1 - The Disappearances in Southaven]], Kael hired the party to investigate the disappearances in Southaven. After their success, the party convinced Kael to hire them to investigate the Southaven Mines in [[Session 2 - Southaven Mines and the Cult's Reach]] and later to rescue a kidnapped child and [[Session 3 - The Hag of Blacktide Swamp]]. Lord Kael initially offered 25 gold for the rescue, but after persistent haggling from Lirielle, Ferinthria, and Momeline, they managed to raise the reward to 40. The nobleman, however, grew visibly irritated by their relentless bargaining. Meanwhile, Dravencoles stood silently aside, his expression tinged with embarrassment - perhaps due to his paladin's sense of honor, which made such negotiations feel inappropriate given the gravity of a kidnapped child. The party really gained his favor and permanent friendship after saving his son from kidnapping in [[Session 5 - The Kidnapping of Brenlan Kael]].
