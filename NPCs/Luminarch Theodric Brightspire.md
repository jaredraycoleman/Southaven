## Description

Luminarch Theodric Brightspire is a commanding figure in his late seventies, standing tall with long white hair and beard meticulously groomed. His piercing gray eyes and resonant voice command attention and respect. He wears the traditional white and gold vestments of [[Church of Elandria]], with a golden circlet marking his position as High Priest and an ornate sunburst staff that glows faintly with divine magic.

Despite his advanced years, Theodric moves with surprising energy, his mind sharp and his will unbreakable.

## Personality

Theodric is a devout believer who sees the world in clear terms—light and darkness, truth and heresy, order and chaos. He is brilliant and utterly convinced that [[Elandria]] guides his judgment. To the faithful, he offers warm blessings and comfort. To those he views as threats to the Church, he shows no mercy.

## Background

Theodric rose quickly through Church ranks due to his exceptional piety and intelligence. He became Luminarch in 1235 at age 45, the youngest in recent history. He personally mentored Prince Aldric during his preparation for kingship (1235-1251) and has served as spiritual advisor to [[King Aldric IX Solborn]] for over thirty years.

Several months ago, Theodric received a concerning letter from Dawnwarden [[Ithilwen Galandel]] in [[Lusteris]], warning of cult activity in the city. Deeply troubled, the Luminarch departed on a personal mission to investigate, leaving [[Castellan Verin]] to manage Church affairs in [[Solaris]] during his absence. He has not been heard from since his departure.
