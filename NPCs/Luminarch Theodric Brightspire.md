## Description

Luminarch Theodric Brightspire is a commanding figure in his late seventies, standing tall with long white hair and beard meticulously groomed. His piercing gray eyes and resonant voice command attention and respect. He wears the traditional white and gold vestments of [[Church of Elandria]], with a golden circlet marking his position as High Priest and an ornate sunburst staff that glows faintly with divine magic.

Despite his advanced years, Theodric moves with surprising energy, his mind sharp and his will unbreakable.

## Personality

Theodric is a devout believer who sees the world in clear terms—light and darkness, truth and heresy, order and chaos. He is brilliant and utterly convinced that [[Elandria]] guides his judgment. To the faithful, he offers warm blessings and comfort. To those he views as threats to the Church, he shows no mercy.

## Background

Theodric rose quickly through Church ranks due to his exceptional piety and intelligence. He became Luminarch in 1235 at age 45, the youngest in recent history. He personally mentored Prince Aldric during his preparation for kingship (1235-1251) and has served as spiritual advisor to [[King Aldric IX Solborn]] for over thirty years.

Several months ago, Theodric received a concerning letter from [[Dawnwarden Ithilwen Galandel]] in [[Lusteris]], warning of cult activity in the city. Deeply troubled, the Luminarch departed on a personal mission to investigate, leaving [[Castellan Verin]] to manage Church affairs in [[Solaris]] during his absence. He has not been heard from since his departure.

%%
**DM ONLY - THEODRIC'S STATUS:**

**Current Location:** [[Lusteris]]

**The Mission:**
- Received genuine letter from [[Dawnwarden Ithilwen Galandel]] about cult concerns
- Left [[Solaris]] months ago to investigate personally
- This was before [[Castellan Verin]] began poisoning [[King Aldric IX Solborn]]
- Has been working with Ithilwen to combat cult presence in Lusteris

**Why He Hasn't Returned:**
- Investigation more complex than expected
- Cult presence in Lusteris is significant
- Communication with Solaris has been difficult (possibly intercepted by Verin)
- Doesn't know what's happening in Solaris with Aldric

**His Previous Influence:**
- Theodric was **previously** poisoned by Verin (1262-early 1267)
- Became increasingly authoritarian and paranoid during those years
- Created tensions with King Aldric before his departure
- Leaving for Lusteris actually removed him from Verin's direct influence
- Has been slowly recovering while away, though doesn't realize he was poisoned

**Current State:**
- More like his old self—rational, compassionate, wise
- Concerned about cult activity but not paranoid
- Unaware of the crisis brewing in Solaris
- Would be shocked to learn what Verin has done to Aldric

**The Cult's Adaptation:**
- Verin's original plan was to corrupt Theodric
- When Theodric left unexpectedly, Verin pivoted to corrupting Aldric instead
- Theodric's absence actually gave Verin better access to the King
- Double benefit: both Church leader gone AND King corrupted

**If Party Finds Him:**
- Can become powerful ally against the cult
- Has knowledge of cult operations in Lusteris
- Will be horrified to learn about Aldric's corruption
- May feel guilty about leaving (though it saved him)
- Can help expose Verin and save Aldric
