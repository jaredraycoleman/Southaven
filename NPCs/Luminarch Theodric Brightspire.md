## Description

Luminarch Theodric Brightspire is a commanding figure in his late seventies, standing tall with long white hair and beard meticulously groomed. His piercing gray eyes and resonant voice command attention and respect. He wears the traditional white and gold vestments of [[The Church of Elandria]], with a golden circlet marking his position as High Priest and an ornate sunburst staff that glows faintly with divine magic.

Despite his advanced years, Theodric moves with surprising energy, his mind sharp and his will unbreakable.

## Personality

Theodric is a devout believer who sees the world in clear terms—light and darkness, truth and heresy, order and chaos. He is brilliant and utterly convinced that [[Elandria]] guides his judgment. To the faithful, he offers warm blessings and comfort. To those he views as threats to the Church, he shows no mercy.

## Background

Theodric rose quickly through Church ranks due to his exceptional piety and intelligence. He became Luminarch in 1235 at age 45, the youngest in recent history. He personally mentored Prince Aldric during his preparation for kingship (1235-1251) and has served as spiritual advisor to [[King Aldric IX Solborn]] for over thirty years.

In recent years, Theodric has become increasingly concerned about heresy and cult activity throughout [[Kingdom of Solara]]. He has advocated for stronger Church authority to combat these threats.

**DM ONLY - THE CORRUPTION:**

Theodric has been systematically poisoned by [[Castellan Verin]], a Black Star cultist, since 1262. Special incense used during evening prayers contains alchemical compounds that amplify paranoia, increase authoritarianism, and impair memory. The corruption is subtle—his core beliefs remain his own, but twisted to extremes.

**Timeline:**
- 1262: Verin joins household, poisoning begins
- 1263-1264: Personality changes accelerate
- 1265-1267: Becomes increasingly extreme, conflicts with King Aldric

**Key Points:**
- Theodric doesn't know he's being manipulated
- His decisions are genuinely his, just pushed to extremes
- Morning = more rational; Evening (after incense) = harsher
- Memory issues for recent events
- Trusts Verin completely

**The Cult's Plan:**
1. Use Theodric to paralyze Solaran leadership
2. Drive wedge between Crown and Church
3. Eventually expose his corruption publicly to destroy Church credibility
4. Verin is expendable—meant to be discovered

**Saving Theodric:**
- Remove from Verin's influence
- Stop the incense
- Medical detoxification (weeks)
- Careful revelation of truth
- May never fully recover from shame/guilt
