## Description  

The half-elf bears the youthful look of someone barely nineteen, though there’s a quiet depth in his eyes that hints at more years than his appearance suggests. Tousled auburn curls frame a face both handsome and expressive—high cheekbones, a sharp jaw, and a light dusting of freckles giving him a roguish charm softened by elven grace. His bright green eyes gleam with warmth and mischief, while his subtly pointed ears reveal his heritage.

Dressed in a green coat over a rust-colored waistcoat and crisp white shirt, he cuts a figure both elegant and approachable. Lean and agile, he carries himself with the easy confidence of one who has seen more of the world than his youthful face lets on.

## Personality  

Lyrian is idealistic, charismatic, and unwavering in his belief in fairness. A strong supporter of the Reformist movement, he believes wealth should serve the people, not be hoarded by the elite. His compassion and eloquence made him beloved among the common folk, though it also made him enemies among the city's nobility and financial elite. Despite his exile, he remains determined to restore justice, refusing to be broken by those who cast him out.  

He harbors no illusions about power—he knows that change is not won through words alone. Though once a firm believer in diplomacy, his betrayal at the hands of Eirik Ravenskald has hardened him. He now understands that true reform may require more than negotiations—it may require action.  

## Background  

Once the respected leader of the Emerald Bank, Lyrian sought to use its wealth to uplift the people of Lusteris, funding public works, education, and economic opportunities for those outside the noble class. His policies made him a champion of the Reformists—but a threat to the city's elite. In a coup orchestrated by Eirik Ravenskald and backed by the Gilded Jackals, Lyrian was forcibly removed from power and barely escaped with his life.  

Now in hiding, rumors persist that he is still alive, working in the shadows to rally allies and take back what was stolen from him. Whether he returns as a diplomat, a revolutionary, or something else entirely remains to be seen—but one thing is certain: Lyrian Brightwind is not finished yet.
