![[Malrec_21171e6f.webp]]

Malrec is a [[Order of the Black Star|Black Star cultist]] and led one of the operations in [[Vel Enweir]]. He led the attack on [[Telor'Augus, The Grove of Fire]], but was defeated by [[Archdruid Thalwen Myr]] and her druids of the flame. After being tortured, he revealed the location of his hideout to the Archdruid and was brought to [[Balandel]] to serve as a witness against [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]] in her trial. 

## Description

Malrec is a gaunt, sharp-eyed devotee of the [[Order of the Black Star]], with features hollowed by years of fanatical devotion and cruel rituals. His skin bears scars from both self-inflicted rites and punishments dealt by his masters. Once clad in ceremonial black robes embroidered with constellations, he now wears the plain shackles of a prisoner. Even in captivity, there is an aura of menace about him—his voice measured and cold, his gaze burning with a dark conviction that imprisonment cannot extinguish.

## Personality

Malrec is ruthless, cunning, and utterly committed to the Black Star's shadowed creed. He delights in sowing fear and doubt, preferring manipulation and psychological torment as much as brute violence. Despite his capture, he exudes a calm, unnerving composure, speaking of destiny and inevitability as though the world itself bends toward the will of his order. To allies he was a zealous leader; to enemies, he is a fanatic who sees their resistance as futile sparks in a coming void.

Yet beneath the zealotry lies bitterness—toward those who bested him, and perhaps toward himself for breaking under torture. Though he revealed his hideout's location, he frames the act as part of a larger design, as though even his betrayal serves the Black Star's will.

## Background

Malrec orchestrated one of the Black Star's key operations in [[Vel Enweir]], leading an assault upon [[Telor'Augus, The Grove of Fire]], a sacred druidic sanctuary. There, he unleashed horrors upon the ancient grove, seeking to corrupt its flames and bend them to his cult's dark ends. His campaign ended in disaster when [[Archdruid Thalwen Myr]] and her druids of the flame rose against him, their numbers and mastery of fire clearly underestimated by his spies. 

Captured and broken, Malrec was subjected to interrogation. Under brutal torture, he revealed the location of his hidden base. Now, he has been brought in chains to [[Balandel]], not as a free man but as a witness in the trial of [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]], where his testimony may tip the scales against her.
