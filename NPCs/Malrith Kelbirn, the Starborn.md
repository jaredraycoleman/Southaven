## Description

Clad in blackened armor and draped in a cloak that seems to drink in the light, Malrith Kelbirn is a figure who inspires awe and dread in equal measure. His long, dark hair whips about like a storm, and his eyes glow faintly red, as if lit from within by a star's dying ember. In one hand he carries a staff crowned with a curling black flame, a symbol of the [[Order of the Black Star]]'s devotion to [[Taelkor|The Unmaker]].

He is called the **Starborn**, whether as prophecy, title, or self-proclaimed truth, none can say. Wherever he appears, his presence bends conversations, allegiances, and even battlefields around him, like a planet caught in the pull of a greater sun.

## Personality

Malrith is not a raving cultist but a visionary tyrant—composed, articulate, and unfalteringly certain of his destiny. His words are soft-spoken yet heavy, like oracles chiseled in stone. He treats allies as disciples, enemies as obstacles, and the world itself as a stage for [[Taelkor]]'s return.

Though he can be patient and calculating, Malrith is utterly merciless when his vision is threatened. He despises [[Pantheon]] of gods who betrayed [[Taelkor]], and he teaches that their Awakening was not a triumph but a weakness—one he intends to erase.

## Background

Malrith's life began in the neon-lit desert city of [[Lusteris]]. Orphaned at birth, he wandered the streets of gamblers, thieves, and hustlers until he was found by a forgotten mystic—one of the last living [[Taelkor]] worshippers. This mentor taught him the secret histories of the Builders, the betrayal of the gods, and the Unmaker's vision of perfect erasure.

Where others had failed to keep the Black Star alive, Malrith succeeded. He combined forbidden knowledge, the underworld cunning of Lusteris, and his own natural charisma to rebuild the [[Order of the Black Star]] from ashes. He restructured it into a true movement—no longer scattered zealots but a vast, disciplined cult spanning cities and kingdoms.

It was Malrith who declared the old prophecies fulfilled: that he was the Starborn, destined to prepare the way for Taelkor's return.
