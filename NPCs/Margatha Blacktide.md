![[Margatha Blacktide_d48e7e38.webp]]
## Description  

For generations, Margatha Blacktide was spoken of in fearful whispers—a specter of dread said to lurk in the depths of Blacktide Swamp. To some, she was merely a folk tale, a bogeyman used to scare unruly children into obedience. To others, she was a real and terrible presence, a monstrous hag who bartered in stolen lives and weaved dark enchantments in the mist-cloaked marshes.  

The truth was far worse.  

Margatha was not merely a legend—she existed, her crumbling hut concealed by powerful illusions, hidden away in the twisted heart of the swamp. Cultists, worshippers of the Black Star, trafficked children into her grasp, trading young lives for dark artifacts and forbidden knowledge. She was a master of deception, luring prey with false kindness before revealing her true, monstrous nature.  

When confronted by the adventurers in [[Session 3 - The Hag of Blacktide Swamp]], she attempted to bargain for her life, offering a potion of terrible power in exchange for her freedom. But in the end, her pleas fell on deaf ears. The party saw through her lies and cut her down, her body withering into blackened cloth and brittle bone as her dying screams faded into the swamp.
