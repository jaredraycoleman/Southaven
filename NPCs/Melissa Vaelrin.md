### Description

In life, Melissa was a quiet elven girl with piercing eyes and a thoughtful manner. In undeath, her revenant form is pale and veiled in sorrowful fury. Her presence chills the air, her voice echoes in the minds of those she haunts. She bears the appearance of her final moments: elegant but scorched, preserved by fury rather than time.

### Personality

Soft-spoken but sharp. Melissa observed more than she spoke, a habit that followed her into death. Though quiet, her emotions run deep—grief, guilt, and rage swirl in equal measure. She does not kill for pleasure but cannot rest while Garrin walks free. Vengeance, to her, is justice.

### Background

The youngest Vaelrin child, Melissa admired her older brother [[Alith Vaelrin]] and quietly tolerated his human friend, [[Garrin Dace]]. On the night of the fire, she witnessed Garrin stash unstable fireworks in the kitchen but chose not to tell anyone. After the explosion, she died with the rest of her family. When her spirit reawakened, twisted by time and pain, she remembered everything. Her hunt led her to Balandel, and to Garrin.
