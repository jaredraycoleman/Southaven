## Description

Milo Puddlewick is a weathered halfling in his late thirties, his youthful features hardened by years of desert sun and combat. His once blond hair has faded to a sandy brown, kept short and practical. His blue eyes carry a haunted look, tempered by quiet resolve.

He wears the light, flowing garb of the desert folk, with leather armor designed for mobility in harsh conditions. A curved blade hangs at his hip, and he moves with the careful alertness of someone who has spent years watching the horizon for threats.

## Background

Milo was born near [[Clover]] to Jory and Tilda Puddlewick—gentle, free-spirited folk. His father was a mushroom-dyer; his mother an herbal midwife and beekeeper. When Milo was eleven, his parents joined a gatherers' caravan into the [[Dragonspire Mountains]] to harvest rare moonmilk caps. Black-cloaked riders slaughtered the caravan. Milo survived only by hiding with his three-year-old sister in a narrow shale cleft.

He carried Momeline to [[Brandyburrow]], where the siblings were taken into Kettlewort House under Matron Bess. Two years later, the riders found them again. They stabbed Momeline on a bridge as she walked home from school. Milo, arriving too late, found only blood on the stones. He believed his sister dead.

Consumed by grief and driven by a need for answers, Milo fled—traveling west to east until he reached [[Khasim's Crown]], a desert realm beyond the [[Witchwood]]. There, he found purpose with the Sirocco Wardens, an order dedicated to defending the oases from undead threats. He blames a necromantic cult for his family's destruction, though the true nature of the [[Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star]] and their reason for hunting his sister remain unknown to him.

He does not know that Momeline survived.
