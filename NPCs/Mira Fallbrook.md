## Description

Mira Fallbrook is a brilliant young alchemist, known for her sharp wit and colder demeanor. She has sleek black hair that cascades to her shoulders, often tied back for practicality, and sharp, calculating hazel eyes that gleam with intelligence. Her presence is commanding, and she wears practical but finely tailored clothing often stained with alchemical experiments.

She carries an assortment of vials strapped to her belt, filled with volatile concoctions. A faint smell of sulfur and herbs lingers wherever she goes. On her left wrist, she bears a faint scar - an alchemical mishap from her early experiments.

## Story

Mira served as [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe]]'s assistant in [[Southaven]], but was secretly working with [[Blacksoul Silas]] and his cult. When the party discovered alchemical ingredients from Wizzlethorpe's shop in the [[Southaven Mines]], suspicion fell on her. Confronted, she trapped Wizzlethorpe in a bottle and fled using a Flamejump Potion, a cruel elixir made by torturing phoenixes.

The party later found her at [[Duskwatch Keep]], under Silas's control through enchantment magic. After defeating a shadow demon Silas summoned, [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] broke through to Mira by speaking of Wizzlethorpe's concern for her. Freed from the spell and overwhelmed with guilt, Mira surrendered.

She helped the party escape the keep and was reunited with Wizzlethorpe in Southaven, who began tending to her injuries and offered her a chance at redemption.
