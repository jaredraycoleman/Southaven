## Description

Mira Fallbrook is a brilliant young alchemist, known for her sharp wit and colder demeanor. She has sleek black hair that cascades to her shoulders, often tied back for practicality, and sharp, calculating hazel eyes that gleam with intelligence. Her presence is commanding, and she wears practical but finely tailored clothing often stained with alchemical experiments.

She carries an assortment of vials strapped to her belt, filled with volatile concoctions. A faint smell of sulfur and herbs lingers wherever she goes. On her left wrist, she bears a faint scar - an alchemical mishap from her early experiments.
