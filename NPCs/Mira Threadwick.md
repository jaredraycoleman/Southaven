## Description

Mira Threadwick is a slender woman in her late thirties with delicate features and nimble fingers that move with practiced precision. Her dark hair is always pinned up in an elegant bun, adorned with colorful thread and small sewing needles like decorative pins. She has keen hazel eyes that can spot a loose stitch from across the room, and she wears her own creations—practical yet stylish dresses with intricate embroidery that showcase her skill.

Her shop is warm and inviting, with bolts of fabric in every color lining the walls, mannequins displaying her latest work, and the constant gentle hum of her spinning wheel. The scent of fresh linen and cedar fills the air.

## Personality

Mira is patient and detail-oriented, taking pride in every stitch and seam. She has an artist's temperament, often lost in thought as she envisions how fabric will drape or which pattern will suit a customer best. While soft-spoken, she's not shy about correcting those who undervalue her craft or try to rush her work—quality takes time, and she won't compromise.

She's kind-hearted and enjoys getting to know her customers, often remembering not just their measurements but their stories, families, and preferences. Mira has a particular fondness for helping young people look their best for important occasions, whether it's a wedding, festival, or first adventure.

## Background

Mira learned tailoring from her mother, who ran a small shop in [[Solaris]] before falling ill. When her mother passed, Mira inherited the business but found the capital's competitive atmosphere stifling. Seeking a fresh start and a quieter life, she moved to [[Southaven]] about eight years ago and opened **Threadwick Tailoring**.

Since then, she's become the town's go-to seamstress for everything from mending work clothes to crafting fine garments for special occasions. She's even begun experimenting with adding minor protective enchantments to traveling cloaks, having learned a few tricks from [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe]] over the years.

Mira maintains connections with fabric merchants in Solaris and occasionally receives shipments of rare textiles, making her shop one of the few places in Southaven where one can find quality cloth and fashionable designs without traveling to the capital.
