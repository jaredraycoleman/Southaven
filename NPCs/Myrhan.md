![[Myrhan_80fb9629.png]]

A Halfling [[Order of the Black Star|Black Star cultist]] operations leader in [[Balandel]]. Myrhan is small in stature, but his wicked face, sadistic dark green eyes, evil grin, and neatly combed hair make him frightening to behold. He looks like the kind of person who enjoys others' pain. 

Myrhan was killed by the party in [[Session 17 - Echoes Beneath the Crypt]].

## Background

He was on his way to [[Duskwatch Keep]] when [[Jesse Durn]] fled with the scrolls of resurrection. He captured him, but took a liking to him and started training him in necromantic magic, promising he would be able to return his sister [[Tessa Durn]] and her boyfriend [[Kaelen Rynn]] to life if he studied hard. They collected their bodies (among others) on their way back from Duskwatch and set up operations in [[Balandel]] on [[Blacksoul Silas]]' orders.
