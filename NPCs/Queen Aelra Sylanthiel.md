## Description  

Queen Sylanthiel of Vel Enweir is an ancient elven monarch whose presence radiates timeless authority. Her silver hair flows like moonlight, and her eyes—cool, sharp, and unblinking—seem to see beyond the present moment. She wears a circlet of woven branches and starlight, and her ceremonial robes are embroidered with sigils of protection and memory. Though she rarely raises her voice, it carries the weight of centuries.
## Personality  

Sylanthiel is regal, measured, and unyielding. She rules not through fear, but through expectation—she assumes obedience, precision, and clarity from those around her. She has little tolerance for mortal impatience, and though she is not cruel, her compassion is distant and hard-earned. Her distrust of outsiders is rooted in long memory, but she values truth when it is bravely spoken. Those who impress her may find a powerful and deeply loyal ally—but those who deceive her rarely get a second chance.
## Background  

Sylanthiel has ruled Vel Enweir for four thousand years, watching empires rise and fall beyond her forest's edge. She inherited a wood fractured by external pressures and internal division, and has since unified its clans under a single banner of protection. A master of ancient magic tied to the land itself, she maintains fragile spiritual and elemental balances across the forest.

Lately, however, rot has taken root in the deeper glades, and strange powers stir at the borders. Rumors of cultists, corrupted beasts, and broken wards have begun to threaten even the inner sanctums of her realm. With war pressing from all sides, Queen Sylanthiel finds herself making rare, reluctant pacts with outsiders. Ones she binds with magic, and watches like a hawk.
