Roswin Brambletoe is a meticulous yet warm-hearted halfling librarian of the [Southaven Library](Southaven%20Library.md), known for his vast knowledge and boundless enthusiasm for books. Despite his small stature, he commands great respect in the library, effortlessly navigating towering shelves with the help of rolling ladders and a well-practiced knack for recalling exactly where every book belongs. His round glasses often slip down his nose as he pores over ancient tomes, and his neatly combed curls bounce with every animated discussion about history, folklore, or arcane mysteries. Though he values quiet study, he delights in guiding curious minds, always eager to match the right book to the right reader. With a sharp wit, a patient demeanor, and a passion for storytelling, Roswin has become not just a keeper of knowledge, but a trusted mentor to scholars, adventurers, and dreamers alike.
