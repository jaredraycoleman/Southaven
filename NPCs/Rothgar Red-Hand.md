## Description

Rothgar "Red-Hand" is a weathered bandit captain whose face tells the story of countless battles. The jagged scar runs from his left temple to his jaw, and his right hand (that earned him his nickname) is permanently stained crimson from an old curse or ritual gone wrong. He wears mismatched armor scavenged from fallen enemies, and a black star amulet hangs prominently around his neck.

His eyes carry the fervor of a true believer, and he speaks of the cult's promises with unsettling conviction. Despite his brutal reputation, he's a veteran commander who knows how to organize and lead men effectively.

## Personality

Rothgar is a pragmatic zealot, a dangerous combination. He believes wholeheartedly in the [[Order of the Black Star]]'s teachings, but he's also experienced enough to know how to survive. He's brutal when necessary but not needlessly cruel, preferring efficiency over spectacle. He commands through a mixture of respect earned from his veteran status and fear inspired by his cult connections. His men know he's connected to something dark and powerful, which keeps them in line even when morale is low.

## Background

Rothgar served for years under [[Donavar Reddmark]] before Donavar's death at the hands of [[Velara Kael]]. When [[Blacksoul Silas]] approached him with promises of power and gold in exchange for controlling the northern approaches to [[Southaven]], Rothgar saw an opportunity to rise from enforcer to commander. 

He established the northern blockade with ruthless efficiency, turning it into a fortified checkpoint that has successfully cut off Southaven's northern supply lines. Unlike some of the more opportunistic bandits at the southern blockade, Rothgar is a true believer who has undergone cult rituals and received the black star brand.

His "red hand" is the result of a blood ritual he performed to prove his loyalty to the Black Star. The stain never fades, serving as both a mark of his devotion and a warning to those who would oppose him.
