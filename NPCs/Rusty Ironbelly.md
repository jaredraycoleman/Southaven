## Description

Rusty Ironbelly is a stout, middle-aged dwarf with a broad chest and arms thick from years of brewing ale and hefting barrels. His fiery red hair and beard are flecked with streaks of gray, often braided with small iron rings. His warm brown eyes twinkle with humor, but they can harden to steel when dealing with troublemakers. Rusty's usual attire is a leather apron stained with ale and a simple shirt rolled up at the sleeves, revealing scars from his wilder days.

Rusty is rarely seen without a tankard in hand, ready to toast with patrons or sip thoughtfully while listening to their woes. His booming laugh echoes across the tavern, and his presence brings an air of safety and camaraderie.

## Personality

Rusty is jovial and welcoming, the heart of his tavern and the glue of the Southaven community. He loves a good story and enjoys ribbing his regulars, but beneath the mirth is a sharp mind and a deep sense of loyalty. He sees his tavern as a sanctuary where everyone - adventurer or commoner - deserves a hearty meal, a strong drink, and a moment's peace.

While he's generally good-natured, Rusty has a low tolerance for bullies or cheaters. He's quick to break up fights with his bark or his fists, though he prefers to settle disputes with words. His dwarven stubbornness shines through when he feels strongly about something, and he'll go to great lengths to protect his tavern and its patrons.

## Background

Rusty hails from a family of miners in the Pale Mountains. After a mine collapse claimed the lives of his brothers, Rusty left the mountains, seeking solace in the open road. He traveled far and wide, learning the art of brewing and forging bonds wherever he went. Eventually, he settled in Southaven, opening **Rusty's Tavern** with a modest stash of gold and a determination to create a home where everyone could feel welcome.

Over the years, Rusty's Tavern has become a hub for travelers, adventurers, and locals alike. Rusty has a knack for remembering names, faces, and favorite drinks, which has earned him the loyalty and trust of many. Though he's hung up his adventuring boots, he keeps his warhammer, “Barrelbreaker,” behind the bar - just in case.
