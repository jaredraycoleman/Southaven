## Description

Serelion Thorneweave carries the aura of a high-ranking druid—commanding, still, and steeped in quiet authority. His pale gold hair is worn in a tight, traditional braid of the Eldergrove, and his robes of sun-dappled green and fire-touched red bear the mark of the Verdant Flame. His voice is calm and unhurried, like wind through ancient branches, and his gaze never seems to blink when held too long.

To most, Serelion is the epitome of balance and wisdom. But beneath his composed surface lies a different truth: he is no longer Serelion, but a Harbinger of the Void wearing his skin. The real ambassador was slain in a moonless grove weeks before his "arrival" in Balandel. This new Serelion, a Black Star cultist of chilling discipline, speaks only of restoring balance—but means annihilation, not harmony.

## Personality

Measured and deliberate, Serelion speaks with the gravitas of one who sees further than others. He seldom raises his voice, preferring to guide conversation with rhetorical questions and unsettling metaphors. He encourages peace in Balandel, but his true aim is entropy. He sees decay not as failure, but as sanctification. He shows no outward cruelty—only inevitability.

Among fellow cultists, his façade drops. His mind is razor-sharp, and his faith in the Black Architect is absolute. Of the three, he is the strategist, the manipulator, the one who speaks the Architect’s tongue in prayer.

## Background

Serelion’s body was taken during the ambush at the Emberfen Crossing. The cultist who now inhabits him—once known only as Threxian Vale—was a former archivist of the Architect’s language. Through subtle manipulations, “Serelion” has since led Balandel’s ambassadorial delegation to a slow ideological fracture. He advocates for the Circle to “reconsider the meaning of fire,” nudging them closer to annihilative doctrine under the guise of theological evolution.
