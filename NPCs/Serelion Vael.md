## Description

Serelion Vael is the kindhearted owner of the [[Scarlet Shield Tavern]] in [[Balandel]], a warm and bustling hearth at the edge of the city’s trade quarter. Tall and wiry, with golden hair and the long ears of his elven lineage, Serelion has a noble air softened by his easy smile and gentle manner. His cloak and simple garb hide the faint scars of a life once lived on the road as a caravan guard, but now his hands are more often found polishing tankards than gripping a blade.

## Personality

Serelion is gracious, attentive, and endlessly patient, known for remembering patrons’ names, their favorite meals, and even their troubles. He is quick to offer kindness, whether through a warm meal, a quiet word, or a strong drink. Though he gives the impression of someone who has put violence behind him, his watchful eyes and deliberate movements suggest a man who remains alert to danger.

## Background

Once a wanderer across the deserts and valleys of Solara, Serelion retired to [[Balandel]] and invested his savings into founding the Scarlet Shield, named after the battered shield he carried during his years as a guard. Over the years, the tavern has become a hub for travelers, adventurers, and locals alike, a place where rumors mix as freely as ale.

Yet Serelion’s life is not as simple as it appears. He is engaged in a secret affair with [[Caelthas Sunstrider]], one of [[Balandel]]’s most honorable and respected officials. The relationship is tender but fraught with risk—should it be discovered, it could endanger both Serelion’s livelihood and Caelthas’s reputation. For now, their bond remains hidden in quiet meetings behind locked doors, masked by the Scarlet Shield’s laughter and song.
