![[Sylvara Greenthorn_84b64cd2.webp|368x368]]
## Description

Sylvara Greenthorn appears as a warm, earth-touched representative of the old groves. Her robes are patched with living moss, and her staff is topped with a glowing seedpod said to pulse with Faeren’s will. She laughs easily, eats heartily, and knows the names of every street vendor in Balandel. The city's people love her.

And yet, of the three, Sylvara’s replacement is the most dangerous. Her former self was incinerated during a ritual “burn-cleansing” deep in Telor’Augus. Her usurper—a Harbinger named **Kaethis Crowroot**—embraced the role with terrifying joy. Beneath her gregarious front lies a furnace of zealotry. She believes that joy and destruction are not opposites, but mirrors.

## Personality

Sylvara plays the fool to disarm suspicion. She is gregarious, chaotic, and full of stories that never seem to end. She sings old songs of the forest, dances in the street, and claims mushrooms speak to her (they do, but not the way she says).

But in private, her demeanor shifts. She becomes silent, ritualistic, and precise. She has no empathy for those she manipulates—only a hunger to feed the cycle of destruction. To her, the Black Architect is not a god, but a gardener—and she is his fire.

## Background

Kaethis once led burnings in the Black Star’s Deeproot Circle—pyres meant to “clear rot from the soul.” She volunteered for the Balandel infiltration not out of duty, but excitement. She thrives in cities. She has already begun sowing strange seeds throughout the lower districts—plants engineered to bloom and wither in a single night, their decay spreading spores of despair and madness.
