![[Tessa Durn_088cb119.webp]]

Tessa Durn is striking in both presence and personality. Her emerald-green eyes gleam with sharp intelligence and an underlying hunger for control. Her fiery red curls frame her face, often adorned with a confident smirk that masks the burdens she carries. She dresses in finely tailored coats, embroidered with silver runes that shift in the light, a reminder of the pact that changed her fate. Her every movement is deliberate—graceful yet commanding, like a queen without a throne.  

Her voice is smooth, measured, and persuasive, honed by years of turning words into weapons. She exudes an aura of authority, a woman who has long since decided she will never be powerless again.

## Story

In [[Session 5 - The Kidnapping of Brenlan Kael]], the party found out that [[Donavar Reddmark]] had hired the Durns to kill the party. In [[Session 6 - The Road to Duskwatch]], the party found the Durns attacking some witches on the road to [[Duskwatch Keep]]. Recognizing the Durns as the ones who were hired to kill them, they defended the witches and killed [[Tessa Durn]] and [[Kaelen Rynn]]. [[Jesse Durn]] got away. In [[Session 26 - The Cultist Hideout]], the party killed Tessa again (at her request).

When Jesse raised Tessa from the dead, she was still herself, but had regular blackouts and is in constant, miserable pain. Because she was resurrected using a necromantic crystal of the [[Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star]], her will was bound to [[Malrith Kelbirn, the Starborn]]. She must serve him, first and foremost, even before her brother.
