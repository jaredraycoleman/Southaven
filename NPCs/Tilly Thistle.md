## Description  

Tilly Thistle is the Dean of the Marble Academy and a Professor of Arcane Studies, known for her composed and authoritative presence. A middle-aged halfling of humble but refined elegance, she dresses in simple but nice robes. Her greying hair is always neatly arranged, and her keen brown eyes radiate both warmth and intelligence. Though she is soft-spoken, her words carry weight, and her reputation as a brilliant scholar and decisive leader is well-earned.  

## Personality  

Tilly is patient, perceptive, and deeply compassionate, balancing intellectual discipline with an unwavering belief in the potential of her students. She holds firm to the idea that magic and knowledge should serve all people, not just the privileged elite. While she is diplomatic and prefers reasoning over confrontation, she is unafraid to challenge outdated traditions or political figures who seek to stifle progress. Her leadership at the Academy reflects her commitment to education, equality, and social reform, making her a key voice in the Reformist movement.  

## Background  

Born into an old but unremarkable family of scholars, Tilly earned her place at the Marble Academy through exceptional skill and relentless dedication. She ascended to Dean not by noble birth, but by merit, making her a symbol of the Reformists' vision for Lusteris. She and her husband, Finn Thistle, have worked tirelessly to modernize magical education, opposing the Academy's more rigid, Traditionalist factions. As political tensions escalate, Tilly's influence makes her a threat to the ruling elite, and when the coup begins, she finds herself at the center of a battle for the city's future.
