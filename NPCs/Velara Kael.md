## Description

Velara Kael, the daughter of Lord Kael of Southaven, embodies the essence of noble grace. With delicate features and striking poise, she captures the attention of all who enter her presence. Her dark blonde hair, often styled in intricate updos and elegant braids, reflects the rich fashions of the nobility, while her attire boasts exquisite fabrics adorned with subtle embroidery that hints at her family's status. Despite her refined appearance, there is an underlying restlessness in her posture—like a bird longing for open skies. 

Velara's soft, intelligent gaze reveals a mind that frequently wanders beyond the confines of her privilege. She navigates the elaborate web of courtly etiquette with ease, but her thoughts often drift towards the world outside the city walls. To superficial observers, she may seem distant and aloof, yet those who engage her find a sharp intellect tempered with a surprising depth of emotion.

## Personality

While Velara performs her duties with the utmost politeness expected of a noblewoman, she possesses an undeniable sharpness that cuts through the mundane expectations of her society. Though her voice is measured and soft, her words can resonate with a lingering impact, earning her both admiration and wariness from those who interact with her. She is not as passive as she appears; beneath her composed exterior lies a fiery spirit eager for change and adventure. 

Velara is an astute observer, often picking up on subtleties in conversations and social dynamics that others overlook. Her interests extend beyond traditional noble pursuits; she longs for the excitement of life outside the estate, leading her to covertly learn about politics, military strategies, and the lives of common folk. 

## Background

As the only child of Lord Kael, Velara was raised in the sheltered embrace of nobility, surrounded by tutors, lavish balls, and expectations of marrying a man who would secure her family's influence. However, tragedy struck when her mother passed, leaving Velara to navigate the pressures of court life alone with her father, who has become increasingly absorbed in political matters.

Despite her father's plans for her future, she finds herself restless—torn between duty and the desires of her heart. As she listens to tales from the outside world from travelers who frequent Rusty's Tavern, she feels a powerful call to adventure. This yearning has ignited a secret ambition within her to forge her own path and not simply follow the one laid out for her.

## Story

**First Meeting**: The party first met Velara at a feast hosted by her father, [[Lord Elrin Kael|Lord Kael]], in [[Session 3 - The Hag of Blacktide Swamp]]. Reserved and intensely observant, she watched the group carefully while her brother [[Brenlan Kael|Brenlan]] enthusiastically bombarded them with questions. [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] gifted both siblings crocodile teeth as souvenirs from their adventure—Brenlan was thrilled, while Velara was quietly amused and grateful.

**A Murder in Cold Blood**: When Brenlan was kidnapped in [[Session 5 - The Kidnapping of Brenlan Kael]], the party tracked down and captured the kidnapper, [[Donavar Reddmark]]. After they rescued Brenlan, Donavar refused to talk, mocking them from his cell. Velara arrived, furious that he still lived, and demanded his execution. When the guards refused on Lord Kael's orders, she seized a guard's spear and ran Donavar through herself. Her father's fury was immediate—he had her dragged to her chambers, but the incident revealed a darker, more dangerous side to the noblewoman.

**Flight to Lusteris**: Velara left [[Southaven]] for [[Lusteris]] on an ambassadorial mission, arriving five days before the party. When they finally found her at the Whisper & Oak Tavern in [[Session 9 - Masks and Motives]], the reunion was awkward—including a suspicious encounter involving men's trousers in her room. She attended the Silver Chair Gala with them, where the party discovered cryptic messages signed "Lady V" that suggested her involvement with [[The Black Thorns]], the city's thieves' guild.

**Rooftop Escape**: In [[Session 10 - Flight and Revelation]], after the party's reckless warehouse attack, Velara confronted them furiously at the tavern. The argument was cut short when [[Baern Ironfist]] and city guards stormed in with orders to arrest her dead or alive. Velara used a sleeping agent on Baern, chaos erupted with both guards and assassins attacking, and the party fought to protect her. After the battle, she whispered "Can I trust you?" and led them on a daring rooftop escape through [[Lusteris]]. They fled to the [[Tilly Thistle|Thistles]]' home, where her connection to the resistance became clearer.

**The Emerald Heist**: During [[Session 12 - The Emerald Heist]], Velara helped reveal that she and the Thistles had been sheltering fugitives, including [[Lyrian Brightwind]], the former High Banker of Lusteris ousted by [[Zahir Tariq]]. When the party was trapped in the vault during their heist of the [[Hammer of Elandria]], Velara arrived with Lyrian and the Black Thorns to extract them, blowing open a tunnel and helping them escape on horseback.

**Journey to Balandel**: Velara accompanied the party to [[Balandel]], conducting research in libraries and helping gather intelligence. In [[Session 17 - Echoes Beneath the Crypt]], she tailed [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]] throughout the city, discovering the Queen entering a locked room deep in the royal library using a golden key. She relayed decoded messages from Lyrian: _"We are resisting. Fighting. Tell Velara I love her."_

**Arrested for Murder**: In [[Session 18 - A Flower for the Dead]], Velara was arrested for murdering Eleanor Vess, the Queen's chief advisor. The party convinced Queen Aelra to visit Velara invisibly in prison, where Velara explained she'd been following the Queen at the exact time of the murder—providing her alibi. She also revealed that Ambassador [[Sylvara Greenthorn]] seemed to know exactly where she was hiding. [[Dravencoles]] suggested checking the murder weapon for tracking magic, which [[Lirielle]] confirmed, shocking the Queen and clearing Velara's name.

**Return to Southaven**: Velara returned with the party to [[Southaven]] with 200 elven troops. During the assault on [[Aramond's Lookout]] in [[Session 27 - Confronting Ghorzak the Red]], she wrestled the serpent-creature that had poisoned [[Talan Windfern]], grappling it with raw determination until she finally pinned it down and prevented its escape.
