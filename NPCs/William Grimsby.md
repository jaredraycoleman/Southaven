## Description

William Grimsby is a rotund, jovial human man in his early 50s with thinning gray hair and a meticulously groomed mustache. His rosy cheeks and cheerful demeanor make him a beloved figure in Southaven. He's often seen wearing a well-worn apron over simple but clean clothes, with a pocket full of small tools and knick-knacks. 

His shop is a cluttered treasure trove of odds and ends, from healing salves and ropes to rare herbs and whimsical trinkets. A brass bell on the counter chimes every time a customer enters, a sound William claims brings good luck.

## Personality

William is warm and approachable, quick to offer advice or share a story from his colorful past. He has a sharp mind for business and an uncanny knack for remembering his customers' preferences, making him indispensable to the townsfolk. Beneath his affable exterior, however, is a shrewd negotiator who knows the value of every item on his shelves.

While generally easygoing, William has little patience for troublemakers or anyone who disrespects his shop. He prides himself on running an honest business and holds a strong sense of community.
## Background

William grew up in a neighboring village but moved to Southaven in his youth, seeking opportunity in the growing mining town. He started as a traveling merchant, building relationships with suppliers and adventurers before settling down to open his store. Over the years, he's become a fixture in the community, known for his dependability and charm.

Though he rarely speaks of his past, William once lived a more adventurous life, traveling far and wide. He occasionally hints at his exploits, such as escaping a bandit raid or bartering with a dragon (a story he swears is true).
