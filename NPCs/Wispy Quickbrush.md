### Description

Wispy Quickbrush is a **bright-eyed halfling** whose hair tumbles in windswept auburn curls streaked with accidental paint. Her cheeks are perpetually smudged with color — proof that inspiration rarely waits for clean hands. She wears an artist’s smock patched with mismatched fabrics and lined with tiny pockets overflowing with brushes, twine, and dried flowers. A small folding easel is strapped to her back beside a worn sketchbook tied with blue ribbon. Her green eyes gleam like spring leaves after rain — alive, curious, and full of laughter.

### Personality

Wispy lives up to her name — a **breeze of energy and color** who flits from one idea to the next. She’s playful, talkative, and prone to daydreaming mid-sentence when a new vision strikes. Every stranger is a potential portrait; every tavern, a gallery waiting to happen. Though whimsical, she has a sincere heart and a knack for lifting spirits with her sketches and kind words.

She believes **art can make even the darkest dungeon a little brighter**, and she’s been known to decorate dungeon walls (to the party’s mild annoyance) with impromptu murals. Her humor is gentle, her mischief harmless — unless she’s caught painting caricatures of town guards.

Wispy values **joy, creativity, and connection**, and treats every face she paints as a story worth remembering.

### Background

Born to traveling performers in **The Merryroot Caravan**, Wispy learned early that life was best lived in color and motion. While her siblings took up juggling and song, she found magic in pigments and parchment, capturing the fleeting beauty of the road.

She left the caravan at sixteen with a pocketful of brushes and a promise to “paint every wonder worth seeing.” Since then, Wispy has roamed the realms as a **portraitist of adventurers**, trading art for stories, meals, or safe passage. Her paintings have earned quiet fame — they seem to shimmer faintly in candlelight, as if her subjects are breathing within them.

Some whisper that Wispy’s brushes are **enchanted by a fey muse**, allowing her to paint what _was_ and what _might yet be_. She just grins and says, “If that’s true, I hope the muse remembers to pay for my next meal.”
