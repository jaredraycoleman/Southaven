## Description  

Yuki Song is the formidable leader of the Silver Chair, one of the most powerful noble families in Lusteris. A striking middle-aged woman of sharp poise and calculated elegance, she dresses in flowing silk robes of deep crimson and silver, always adorned with subtle yet unmistakable symbols of her family's prestige. Her dark, meticulously styled hair frames piercing black eyes that miss nothing. She moves with the confidence of someone who knows the power she holds and wields it with precision.  

## Personality  

Yuki is intelligent, pragmatic, and ruthlessly strategic, always thinking several moves ahead. A master of diplomacy and political maneuvering, she commands respect through calm authority rather than overt force. She is a Traditionalist, believing in order, hierarchy, and the supremacy of the nobility, but she is no blind ideologue—she understands that power must be maintained through adaptability as much as strength. While she rarely acts out of cruelty, she is unafraid to eliminate obstacles—whether through negotiation, manipulation, or more direct means.  

## Background  

Born into privilege, Yuki was groomed from childhood to lead the Silver Chair, inheriting a dynasty built on wealth, influence, and carefully cultivated alliances. She has spent years expanding her family's control, ensuring that their interests remain central to the political landscape of Lusteris. She views the Reformist movement as a dangerous disruption to the city's balance of power, though she is not entirely dismissive of its ideals—only the chaos it threatens to bring. As tensions rise and the city teeters on the edge of upheaval, Yuki must decide whether to preserve the status quo at all costs or adapt to the shifting tides to secure her own future.
