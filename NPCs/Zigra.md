## Description

Zigra is a young goblin hexer with distinctive markings and fierce intelligence in her eyes. She wears bone charms and carries a gnarled staff decorated with fetishes and totems. Her skin is a mottled green-grey, and her sharp features show both her goblin heritage and the weight of recent tragedy. She dresses in a mix of traditional goblin shamanic garb and scavenged pieces from the raids. Multiple pouches and ritual components hang from her belt, and she moves with the cautious awareness of someone who has learned to expect betrayal.

## Personality

Zigra was once curious and willing to see the best in others—traits that led her to help the party when they first encountered her tribe. Now, after the party's betrayal resulted in her father's death, she's bitter, vengeful, and filled with hate for those she once tried to help.
She's intelligent and magically talented, having inherited her hexer abilities from her mother. She understands the bigger picture of the siege and the cult's manipulation of the goblin tribes, but she's trapped between her desire for revenge against the party and her growing realization that the goblins are being used as pawns.

Zigra is torn between her personal hatred and her practical understanding that the party might be the goblins' best chance of survival. This internal conflict makes her unpredictable and dangerous.

## Background

Zigra is the daughter of [[Chief Gralduk|Chief Gralduk]], leader of a goblin tribe in the mountains. When the party first encountered her tribe, she was captured but then released. She led the party to her camp, believing that diplomacy might prevent bloodshed. The party negotiated with her father and initially seemed to help evacuate the non-combatants. However, they then betrayed the tribe, signaling the dwarf army to attack. In the resulting battle, Chief Gralduk was killed along with many of his warriors.

Zigra barely escaped the massacre. Filled with grief and rage, she made her way to the larger goblin war camp led by [[Ghorzak the Red|Warchief Ghorzak]], where she now serves as an advisor and hexer. She's shared her story with other goblins, making the party's reputation among the tribes extremely hostile.

Now, working under Warchief Ghorzak, Zigra has learned that the [[Order of the Black Star]] is manipulating the goblins, promising eternal glory while planning to sacrifice them once Southaven falls. She's discovered evidence of this betrayal but isn't sure what to do with the information—the cult overseer at the camp watches her closely.

## Current Situation

Zigra is at the goblin war camp east of Southaven, serving as one of Warchief Ghorzak's advisors. She performs rituals and provides magical support for raids. She's aware of the cult's true plans but hasn't revealed this to the other goblins yet, fearing the cult overseer's retaliation.

If the party encounters her, she will be hostile but conflicted. Part of her wants them dead for what they did to her father and tribe. Part of her realizes they might be the only ones who can stop the cult from destroying all the goblin tribes.
