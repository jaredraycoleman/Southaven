Elysara Frostweave is a graceful mountain elf with deep indigo skin and a talent for weaving protection spells into every thread. She has long, flowing silver-white hair and wears elegant robes shimmering with subtle iridescence like moonlight on snow. Her fingers are nimble and quick, perfect for her delicate craftwork. Her eyes are a pale lavender color that seems to glow softly.
