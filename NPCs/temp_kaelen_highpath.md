Kaelen Highpath is a weathered mountain elf guide with pale blue skin and countless stories of navigating the Dragonspire peaks. He has weathered features with laugh lines around his eyes and a practical, sturdy build. His hair is salt-and-pepper, tied back in a simple ponytail. He wears durable travel clothes, fur-lined boots, and carries climbing gear. His hands are rough from years of rope work and mountain climbing.
