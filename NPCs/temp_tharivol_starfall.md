Tharivol Starfall is a blue-skinned elf smith with silver hair bound in intricate braids and eyes like polished ice. His work is precise, patient, and renowned throughout the Dragonspires. He wears a leather apron over simple but well-made clothing, with tools hanging from his belt. His muscular arms show the strength required for smithing, and his hands are calloused from years of working metal.
