Veloren Lanternkeeper is a jovial mountain elf with cerulean skin and laugh lines around his eyes. He welcomes every traveler as family and keeps a fire burning in every hearth. He has a warm, welcoming smile and bright, twinkling eyes. His hair is dark blue with streaks of silver. He wears comfortable innkeeper's clothes - a well-worn apron over sturdy tunic and trousers. His hands are strong from years of hospitality work.
