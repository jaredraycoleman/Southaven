![[The Emerald Bank_8881419b.webp]]

The Emerald Bank is the economic powerhouse of Lusteris, serving as the financial heart of the city. The bank is responsible for managing the city's wealth, trade, taxation, and commerce. Unlike the other guilds, the bank is governed by a congress of elected representatives who oversee its operations and policies. Despite this, much of the bank's power is concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy families and influential merchants who control its operations. Lately, though, a majority that values social justice and equality has been elected, leading to better conditions for the common folk. Many of Lusteris' most powerful and wealthy citizens aren't happy about the direction the bank is taking.
