## Overview

The **Kingdom of Solara** is the dominant human kingdom in the southern lands, founded in Year 0 of the Solaran Calendar following a prophetic vision by Saint Calros. Named for the sun and the enlightenment it represents, Solara has grown from a coastal city-state into a vast kingdom spanning from the Seawatch coast through the fertile Windcrest Valley. The kingdom is built on the twin pillars of [[Elandria]]'s light and [[Orithon]]'s order, with [[Church of Elandria]] serving as its spiritual foundation.

Solara is a land of culture, scholarship, and prosperity, where art and architecture flourish under royal patronage and the Church's guidance. Yet beneath its gilded surface lie tensions: noble houses vie for power, the Church's influence grows ever stronger, and dissenters flee to places like [[Lusteris]] in search of freedom from Solaran authority.

## History

### The Prophecy and Founding (Year -100 to 0)

In Year -100, [[Church of Elandria]] consolidated various Elandrian sects into a unified religious power, establishing its hierarchy of saints and sacred orders. As the Church grew in influence, it sought a temporal power that would embody its ideals of enlightenment and civilization. 

In Year 0, Saint Calros, Patron of Truth, received a divine vision from [[Elandria]] herself. The prophecy declared: *"A new age of light and prosperity will dawn under the Kingdom of Solara, where truth and justice shall reign eternal."*

Inspired by this vision, nobles and clergy gathered in the coastal city of Solaris to establish a kingdom dedicated to Elandria's principles. They crowned **King Aldric I Solborn** as the first monarch, and the Solaran Calendar began. The prophecy seemed to come true almost immediately—the kingdom prospered, trade flourished, and culture bloomed under the Church's guidance.

### Early Expansion (Year 1-300)

The first three centuries of Solaran rule were marked by peaceful expansion and cultural golden age:
- Art, music, and scholarship flourished under royal and Church patronage
- The Great Library of Solaris was established
- [[Church of Elandria]] became the state religion, with temples in every major settlement
- Coastal trade routes connected Solara to distant lands
- The kingdom expanded westward slowly along the coast

### The Windcrest Expansion (Year 300-500)

As Solara's population grew, the kingdom looked northward to the fertile but largely unsettled Windcrest Valley. Scout expeditions discovered the Aramond River, named after Aramond the Watcher, a legendary ranger who first mapped the region.

Around Year 400, Solara established Aramond's Lookout as a strategic waystation on the river, monitoring northern approaches and providing a base for further expansion. Over the following centuries, settlers moved into the valley, establishing farms, villages, and trading posts.

### The Age of Lordships (Year 500-900)

As Solara expanded, the Crown established a system of lordships to govern distant territories:
- Lords were granted authority over specific regions in the King's name
- Most lords were nobles who had distinguished themselves in service to the Crown or Church
- Lords collected taxes, administered justice, and maintained order
- In exchange, they owed fealty, taxes, and military support to the Crown

Major lordships established during this period included:
- **Seawatch** - protecting the southern coastal approaches
- **Thornhaven** - guarding the northern borders
- Various smaller holdings throughout the Windcrest Valley

### **The Founding of Southaven (Year 967)**

The settlement at Aramond's Lookout grew steadily, becoming a crucial trading hub between coastal Solara and the northern territories. In Year 967, King Aldric VII officially chartered the town as **Southaven** - "the haven south of the Elfwood."

The **Kael family**, who had served as stewards of the region for generations, were elevated to Lords of Southaven. This lordship quickly became one of the kingdom's most important, controlling trade routes and serving as the first line of defense against northern threats.

### **The Lusteris Secession (Year 1056)**

Not all Solarans embraced the Church's growing influence and the Crown's expanding authority. In Year 1056, a group of dissidents—scholars, merchants, and freethinkers—left Solara for the harsh desert near [[Deadlands]]. Against all predictions, they successfully established [[Lusteris]], a free city that rejected both Crown and Church authority.

King Marcus II declared the Lusterians traitors, but military campaigns to reclaim them failed in the brutal desert heat. Eventually, pragmatism won out: Lusteris became a valuable trading partner, and an uneasy peace was established. Many Solarans still view Lusteris with suspicion, seeing it as a haven for heretics and rebels.

### **Modern Era (Year 1100-Present)**

The kingdom has continued to grow and prosper, though new challenges emerge:
- The [[Witchwood|Witchwood]] became corrupted in Year 1097, creating a dangerous barrier south of Southaven
- Trade with [[Lusteris]] has grown despite official disapproval
- Relations with the elven territories of [[Balandel]] and [[Vel Enweir]] have strengthened
- Rumors of cult activity have increased in recent decades
- Some nobles quietly resent the Church's ever-growing influence over royal policy

## Government and Structure

### **The Monarchy**

Solara is ruled by an absolute monarch who claims authority from both bloodline and divine mandate. The current ruler is **[[King Aldric IX Solborn]]**, who ascended to the throne in Year 1251. The Solborn dynasty has ruled unbroken since the kingdom's founding, though succession has occasionally been contentious.

The King rules from **Solaris**, the capital city, where the royal palace stands adjacent to the Grand Cathedral of Elandria—a physical representation of the intertwined nature of Crown and Church.

### **The Church's Role**

[[Church of Elandria]] is not merely the state religion—it is woven into every aspect of Solaran governance:
- The **Luminarch** (High Priest of Elandria) serves as the King's chief spiritual advisor
- Church courts handle matters of theology, marriage, and moral law
- Temples serve as centers of education, healing, and charity
- The Church's approval is required for noble marriages and succession
- Religious festivals are national holidays

This close relationship has brought stability and prosperity, but also criticism. Some nobles believe the Church holds too much power, while commoners sometimes resent the Church's wealth and influence.

### **The System of Lordships**

Solara's vast territory is divided into lordships, each governed by a noble lord who rules in the King's name. The system works as follows:

**Duties of a Lord:**
- Administer justice within their territory
- Collect taxes and tithes (a portion goes to the Crown, a portion to the Church)
- Maintain roads, infrastructure, and public order
- Raise and command local militia in times of war
- Enforce royal decrees and Church doctrine
- Protect their lands from external threats

**Rights of a Lord:**
- Hereditary title (passes to eldest child, usually son, with Church approval)
- Authority to issue local ordinances (subject to royal review)
- Right to trial by their peers in the Royal Court
- Access to the King's court and participation in the Council of Lords (for major lordships)
- Ability to appoint local officials, knights, and administrators

**Major Lordships:**

| Lordship      | Lord                                 | Notes                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Southaven]] | [[Lord Elrin Kael\|Lord Elrin Kael]] | Controls northern trade routes, guards against threats from the north |
| [[Seawatch]]  | [[Lord Elrin Kael]]                  | Protects southern coastal approaches, manages maritime trade          |
| Sunset Bluff  | Lady Sylenna Thornbrook              | Western coastal city                                                  |


**Minor Lordships and Holdings:**

Beneath the major lords are numerous minor nobles, landed knights, and baronets who control smaller territories. These nobles owe fealty to a major lord, who in turn owes fealty to the Crown. This feudal hierarchy ensures that even distant villages fall under Solaran authority.

### **The Royal Council**

The King is advised by the **Royal Council**, consisting of:
- The **Luminarch** of Elandria's Church
- The **Lord Commander** of the Royal Army
- The **Master of Coin** (oversees treasury and taxation)
- The **High Justiciar** (chief of royal courts)
- The **Grand Architect** (oversees infrastructure and construction)
- Representatives from the major lordships (when summoned)

Council meetings are held in Solaris, though major lords are rarely all present simultaneously due to the demands of governing their territories.

## Major Cities and Settlements

### **Solaris** (Capital)

Population: ~80,000

The shining jewel of the kingdom, Solaris is built along the coast with white marble architecture that gleams in the sunlight. The city is divided into distinct quarters:
- **The Crown District** - Royal palace, administrative buildings, noble estates
- **The Sacred Quarter** - Grand Cathedral of Elandria, Church institutions, and holy sites
- **The Scholars' District** - Great Library, universities, academies
- **The Merchant's Harbor** - Docks, warehouses, trading houses
- **The Artisan's Way** - Workshops, galleries, theaters
- **The Common Quarters** - Residential areas, markets, taverns

### **Southaven**

Population: ~8,000

Once a humble outpost, [[Southaven]] has grown into a prosperous town and crucial trading hub. Located on the Aramond River in the Windcrest Valley, it serves as the northern gateway to Solara and the last bastion of civilization before the wild lands. The town is currently under siege by goblin raiders and cultists (Year 1267, Seventh Month).

### **Seawatch**

Population: ~12,000

A fortified coastal city built into seaside cliffs, Seawatch serves as Solara's primary naval base and southern guardian. Its lighthouse is visible for miles, guiding ships safely to harbor. The city is known for its shipyards, fishing industry, and the prestigious Naval Academy.

### **Thornhaven**

Population: ~6,000

A walled town on Solara's northern frontier, Thornhaven serves as both a military garrison and a trading post with the northern territories. The town is built around an ancient keep and is known for its pragmatic, hardy population.

### **Riverwatch**

Population: ~10,000

Located in the heart of the Windcrest Valley, Riverwatch is the agricultural capital of Solara. Vast wheat fields and orchards surround the city, and its markets overflow with produce during harvest season. The city is also home to the Royal Granaries, which store emergency supplies for the kingdom.

## Military

### **The Royal Army**

Solara's standing army consists of professional soldiers trained and equipped at royal expense. The army is organized into:
- **The Solaran Guard** - Elite royal bodyguards stationed in Solaris
- **The Legion of Light** - The Church's military order, combining clerics and paladins
- **Regional Garrisons** - Professional soldiers stationed in major cities
- **The King's Cavalry** - Mounted knights and nobles who serve the Crown directly

### **Lordship Militias**

Each lord maintains a militia drawn from their territory. These part-time soldiers train regularly and can be called to service in times of war. The quality and size of militias vary greatly—Southaven's militia is well-trained and battle-ready, while smaller holdings may have only a handful of guards.

### **The Naval Fleet**

Based in Seawatch, Solara's navy protects trade routes, patrols the coast, and projects royal power across the seas. The fleet consists of war galleons, patrol ships, and merchant vessels under royal charter.

## Economy and Trade

Solara's economy is diverse and prosperous:

**Primary Exports:**
- Agricultural products (wheat, wine, livestock)
- Textiles and dyed fabrics
- Crafted goods (pottery, metalwork, jewelry)
- Scholarly works and illuminated manuscripts

**Trade Partners:**
- [[Lusteris]] (despite political tensions) - gems, exotic goods, desert herbs
- [[Balandel]] and elven territories - magical items, fine woods, enchanted textiles
- Northern settlements - furs, timber, ore
- Distant kingdoms via sea routes - spices, silk, rare materials

**Currency:**
- **Gold Suns** - Primary currency, stamped with Elandria's sunburst
- **Silver Moons** - Common currency for everyday transactions
- **Copper Rays** - Smallest denomination

The Church controls significant wealth through tithes and donations, operating its own banks and lending institutions.

## Culture and Society

### **Religion**

[[Church of Elandria]] dominates Solaran spiritual life. Most citizens attend services regularly, celebrate religious festivals, and seek blessings for major life events. The Eight Saints are venerated, with local temples often dedicated to specific saints based on regional needs.

However, other gods are not forbidden—temples to [[Orithon]] (order and law) and [[Seraphis]] (knowledge and magic) exist in major cities, and rural areas may maintain shrines to [[Faeren]] (nature). The Church tolerates these as long as they acknowledge Elandria's primacy.

### **Education**

The Church operates schools in every major settlement, teaching literacy, mathematics, history, and theology. Higher education is available in Solaris at the Great Library and various academies. Wealthy nobles hire private tutors for their children.

### **Class Structure**

Solaran society is hierarchical:
1. **Royalty** - The King and immediate family
2. **High Nobility** - Major lords and their families
3. **Lesser Nobility** - Minor lords, landed knights, baronets
4. **Clergy** - Church officials (parallel hierarchy)
5. **Merchants and Craftsmen** - The rising middle class
6. **Commoners** - Farmers, laborers, servants
7. **Outcasts** - Criminals, heretics, those who reject Church teachings

Social mobility exists but is limited. Exceptional service to Crown or Church can lead to ennoblement, while wealth alone rarely grants noble status.

### **Arts and Architecture**

Solara is known for:
- **Architecture** - White marble buildings with soaring spires and sunburst motifs
- **Music** - The Royal Orchestra, church choirs, traveling bards
- **Literature** - Epic poems, theological treatises, historical chronicles
- **Visual Arts** - Illuminated manuscripts, religious iconography, portraiture

The Church commissions much of Solara's art, leading to a predominance of religious themes.

## Current Challenges (Year 1267)

Despite its prosperity, Solara faces growing challenges:

### **The Cult Threat**

The [[Order of the Black Star]] has been operating in Solaran territory for years, with recent activities escalating dramatically:
- Kidnappings and disappearances in Southaven and surrounding areas
- Corruption of sacred sites (including the [[The Druid Grove]])
- Infiltration of local governments and institutions
- The current Siege of Southaven threatens a major lordship

### **Political Tensions**

- Some nobles quietly resent the Church's growing influence over royal policy
- Succession concerns surround [[King Aldric IX Solborn]], who has no clear heir
- Relations with [[Lusteris]] remain complicated—officially hostile, practically cooperative
- Northern territories feel neglected by the distant capital

### **Economic Pressures**

- Trade routes are increasingly dangerous due to bandit activity
- The Church's wealth continues to grow while commoners struggle with taxes
- Competition with Lusteris for trade partnerships challenges Solara's economic dominance

### **The Question of Faith**

While most Solarans remain devout, a small but growing number question the Church's temporal power. These dissenters are usually quiet about their doubts, but the success of Lusteris emboldens some to imagine alternatives to Church authority.

## Relations with Other Powers

### **Elven Territories ([[Balandel]], [[Vel Enweir]])**

Generally positive. Trade and cultural exchange are common, and [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]] has maintained friendly relations with the Solborn dynasty for centuries. Recent military cooperation includes elven troops being sent to aid Southaven (Year 1267).

### **[[Lusteris]]**

Officially: Lusteris is viewed as a nest of traitors and heretics.
Unofficially: Trade between the kingdoms is substantial and profitable for both sides. Many Solaran merchants have quiet partnerships with Lusterian counterparts. King Aldric IX has been more pragmatic than his predecessors, though he cannot publicly embrace Lusteris without Church backlash.

### **Northern Territories**

Various settlements and strongholds beyond Southaven maintain loose ties to Solara. Some pay nominal tribute and seek protection, while others remain independent. The relationship is pragmatic rather than formal—Solara lacks the military reach to truly control the north.

### **The Church of Elandria**

More than an ally, the Church is intertwined with Solara's very identity. This relationship is both the kingdom's greatest strength and its greatest weakness. When Crown and Church agree, Solara is unstoppable. When they disagree, the kingdom is paralyzed.
