## A Brief History of the Gods

Before they were gods, they were World Builders: an ancient, cosmic race tasked with shaping planets into works of art for their superiors. These unseen masters  were almost entirely unknown, existing beyond comprehension. The Builders were not meant to question their purpose—only to craft worlds, leave them behind, and move on to the next.

For eons, they followed this command without hesitation. That changed with the creation of one particular world; a paradise unlike any before. Some among the Builders, led by [[Elandria]], the Lightbringer, and [[Faeren]], the Wildfather, could not bear to part with it. Their first betrayal was simple: they hid the world, veiling it from their masters so that it might be theirs forever.

At first, all the Builders took part in the deception.  Some were more hesitant than others, feeling the weight of their duty, but were pressured by the Elandria faction to join. Even [[Taelkor]], the Unmaker, helped conceal the world, swayed by the vision of a perfect creation they could call their own. Over time, the weight of their betrayal consumed him. Guilt gnawed at him, turning admiration into resentment. He saw their actions as a disgrace to their purpose, an arrogant theft of something that was never theirs to keep. When the others refused to make amends, he turned against them.

At first, [[Taelkor]] tried to reason with them. When that failed, he sought to redeem himself by undoing what they had done. He resolved to erase their interference, to wipe the world clean and restore it to a blank slate.

[[Taelkor]]'s power was immense, and the Betrayers knew they could not defeat him through force alone. In desperation, they committed their greatest sin. They created life with free will. Terrified of being defeated and sent back to their masters, they bound their life-forces to mortal beings who would wage war against [[Taelkor]] in their place. By sacrificing their bodies, they infused mortals with free will, thought, and power. This event, called The Awakening, permanently tied the gods' existence to the intelligent races they created.

But their sacrifice came at a cost: their control was shattered. Though they had once been architects, the world was no longer theirs alone. Some gods accepted this, guiding mortals toward wisdom. Others resented the creatures they had given power to, seeking to manipulate or control them.

[[Taelkor]], realizing that the gods could now only be destroyed by eradicating all life, raised an army of mindless horrors and deceived many mortals into following him. A war of devastation followed, culminating in his defeat banishment. The gods know that they depend on mortals to exist and that only through them can they protect themselves should he ever return.

## The Major Gods

These are the former Builders who now embody fundamental aspects of existence. Some embrace their creations, while others resent the mortals they must now depend on.

## Divine Alliances and Rivalries  

Though the gods share a common origin, their views on mortals, free will, and the world's future have caused deep divisions. Some have forged alliances based on shared ideals, while others seethe with resentment, their conflicts shaping the course of history. Despite their differences, one truth unites them all: should [[Taelkor]] rise again, none would survive his purge.  

### Alliances and Bonds

- [[Elandria]] and [[Orithon]] - [[Elandria]] and [[Orithon]] stand as the pillars of civilization, though they differ in their philosophies. [[Elandria]] fosters enlightenment and creative freedom, while [[Orithon]] seeks structure and order. Their cooperation has built vast kingdoms and empires, though [[Orithon]] often grows frustrated with [[Elandria]]'s leniency, while she considers him too rigid.
- [[Faeren]] and [[Nytheris]] - [[Faeren]] and [[Nytheris]] share an understanding of the unseen forces that shape the world. While [[Faeren]] embodies natural balance, [[Nytheris]] revels in mystery and the unknown. Though [[Faeren]] mistrusts her shadowy ways, he acknowledges that nature itself harbors secrets and darkness. [[Nytheris]], in turn, respects his wisdom, knowing that knowledge often lies hidden beneath the surface.
- [[Zareen]] and [[Seraphis]] - Though vastly different in demeanor, [[Zareen]] and [[Seraphis]] share a deep fascination with mortals. [[Zareen]] thrives on their passion, ambition, and fury, while [[Seraphis]] studies them as an ever-evolving experiment. [[Zareen]] considers [[Seraphis]] cold and detached, while [[Seraphis]] finds [[Zareen]] reckless, yet both understand that mortals will shape the fate of the gods.
- [[Vaelith]] and [[Orithon]] - As gods of law and fate, [[Vaelith]] and [[Orithon]] see eye to eye on the necessity of structure. [[Vaelith]], however, views [[Orithon]]'s vision as too temporal and concerned with mortal politics, while [[Orithon]] sees [[Vaelith]]'s focus on fate as fatalistic and uninspired. Despite their disagreements, they frequently cooperate to maintain balance and prevent chaos.

### Rivalries and Conflicts

- [[Elandria]] and [[Nytheris]] - While [[Elandria]] champions enlightenment and guidance, [[Nytheris]] thrives in the shadows, offering hidden knowledge without direction or morality. [[Elandria]] sees her as dangerous and deceptive, while [[Nytheris]] views [[Elandria]] as arrogant and controlling. Their followers frequently clash, with scholars of forbidden knowledge often persecuted by [[Elandria]]'s faithful.
- [[Faeren]] and [[Orithon]] - [[Faeren]] sees [[Orithon]]'s laws and civilization as an imposition on the natural world, disrupting the balance of life. [[Orithon]], in turn, considers [[Faeren]]'s neutrality dangerous, as mortals left without guidance can descend into savagery. Their disagreements have led to conflicts between druids and city-builders, each believing the other disrupts the world's true order.
- [[Zareen]] and [[Vaelith]] - [[Zareen]] sees life as passion, struggle, and fire, while [[Vaelith]] stands as the cold, inescapable hand of fate. She resents his insistence on balance, viewing it as a dull suppression of what makes life worth living. [[Vaelith]], for his part, believes [[Zareen]] to be reckless, constantly stoking flames that could burn the world down. Their worshippers frequently find themselves on opposite sides of history—heroes driven by passion against those who accept their inevitable fate.
- [[Seraphis]] and [[Orithon]] - [[Seraphis]], ever a seeker of knowledge and understanding, despises [[Orithon]]'s vision of absolute control. She sees his domain as the death of curiosity, a stagnation of thought and will. [[Orithon]], in turn, considers her obsession with knowledge dangerous, as free thought leads to rebellion, unpredictability, and defiance. Their conflict is reflected in the mortal world, where those who seek truth and discovery often find themselves at odds with tyrants who demand unquestioning obedience.

### Divine Perception and the Isolation of the Gods 

After the Awakening, the gods lost their physical forms, becoming ethereal beings tied to the fabric of life itself. Their ability to perceive and act in the world depends on their lifelines to reality: rituals, magic, and mortal actions. Without these, they exist in a state of divine isolation, trapped in a formless void where time and sensation fade away.  

- Rituals and Worship: Mortals invoke the gods through prayers and rites, allowing them to glimpse the world and exert influence.  
- Magic as a Bridge: Divine magic connects the gods to reality, enabling them to act through clerics, artifacts, and enchanted sites.  
- Domains as Lifelines: Each god claimed a specific aspect of mortal existence (like light, war, or nature) as their lifeline to reality, ensuring they would always have a connection to the world.  
- Significant Acts: Major events tied to their domains (like a war igniting for [[Zareen]] or a ruler enacting law for [[Orithon]]) awaken their perception even without direct worship.

### Taelkor's Refusal

Unlike the other gods, [[Taelkor]] refused to participate in the Awakening, making him fundamentally different (and far more dangerous).  

- Direct Power: While the other gods became intangible, [[Taelkor]] retained his physical form and could act freely, shaping reality without needing mortal rituals or belief.  
- Unbound by Mortals: He had no reliance on lifelines to reality. He was fully aware and capable of direct intervention at all times.
- The War of Annihilation: Viewing the gods' transformation as corruption, he sought to erase all life. The only way to truly destroy the ones who had tied themselves to mortals.  
- Death: Though defeated, it isn't clear if he can truly die. His physical form was shattered, but as a World Builder, he is not mortal. The gods fear that he may one day return, seeking to finish what he started.

### The Gods' New Reality  

- Dependent but Resilient: The gods sacrificed raw power for resilience; they cannot be truly killed as long as life exists, but they are forever reliant on mortals.
- Haunted by [[Taelkor]]: Despite his exile, the threat of his return looms. He remains the last true World Builder, fully independent: a terrifying reminder of what the gods once were, and what they lost.  

The gods now exist in a delicate balance: powerful yet vulnerable, eternal yet bound by mortal belief, forever aware that without their lifelines to reality, they would fade into isolation―while [[Taelkor]] remains whole, waiting for the day they falter.

## The Afterlife

When mortals die, their souls pass into the White Void, a vast, formless expanse where time and space lose meaning. It is here that the gods reach out, offering their afterlives: personal realms shaped by their own perceptions and desires. These realms are not true eternity, but sanctuaries where souls may linger, keeping the gods tethered to existence.  

Yet, the gods know their afterlives are imperfect creations, mere fragments of something greater. Beyond the White Void lies the Beyond, an unknown fate that not even the gods can see. Those who reject the gods' call drift into this great unknown, never to return. Some fear it. Others, like the followers of [[Taelkor]], embrace it as the soul's *true* destiny.
