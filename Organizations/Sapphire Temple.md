The Sapphire Temple is the spiritual center of Lusteris, serving as a place of worship, healing, and divine guidance. The temple is not dedicated to a single deity but rather to a pantheon of gods and goddesses who are revered by the people of the city. The temple's leader, called the High Priest or High Priestess, has always been an Elandria worshipper. The temple is a place of solace and sanctuary for the people of Lusteris, offering healing, counsel, and spiritual guidance to all who seek it. The temple is also a center of learning and scholarship, with its priests and priestesses studying ancient texts, performing rituals, and conducting ceremonies to honor the gods.
