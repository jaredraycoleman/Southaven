The Black Thorns are a bandit faction known for stealing from the rich and distributing their spoils among the poor. They often clash with the [Duskrunners](The%20Duskrunners.md) and the [Gilded Jackals](../organizations/the_gilded_jackals.md) are not fond of them either. The Black Thorns see themselves as champions of the downtrodden, while the Duskrunners view them as reckless idealists.

The Black Thorns are led by a charismatic and enigmatic figure known only as the Thorn. Little is known about her origins or motivations, but her followers are fiercely loyal and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve her vision of a fairer world. The Black Thorns started in Lusteris but are gaining influence in other cities including Balandél, Fadrín, Southaven, Seawatch, and Solara.
