## Description

The Balandel Courthouse is a stately wooden hall built to harmonize with the great trees of the city’s civic quarter. Its outer walls are crafted from polished oak and cedar, elegantly carved with flowing motifs of sunbursts, lanterns, and flowering branches—symbols of [[Elandria|Elandria, the Lightbringer]]. Wide windows framed in delicate latticework allow sunlight to spill across its facade, giving the impression that the building itself glows with quiet radiance.

Inside, smooth timber beams arch overhead like the canopy of a forest, while silver-inlaid panels depict scenes of wisdom and mercy from Elandria's teachings. The main chamber is open and airy, its benches arranged in gentle curves rather than rigid lines, fostering a sense of communal judgment rather than harsh authority. Though humble in material, the courthouse exudes dignity, embodying the balance of justice, enlightenment, and harmony with nature.

## Background
