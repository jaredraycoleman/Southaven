The political and spiritual heart of [[Vel Enweir]], Balandel is a city of woven trees and luminous stone, suspended between branches and waterfalls. Walkways of pale wood curve between enormous silverwood trunks. Singing vines grow along archways, and moonlight dances on reflecting pools designed to hold it like still water.

[[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]]'s palace sits at the highest point, an open-air sanctum surrounded by silent gardens and high watch-boughs.

| ![[celine_aravel.webp\|100]]        | **The Velvet Crust** *(Magical Pastries & Enchanted Baked Goods)*  <br><br>Tucked between a perfumery and a bookshop that refuses to alphabetize, The Velvet Crust is a narrow little patisserie with deep red awnings and frosted-glass windows etched in swirling, floury runes. The smell—warm butter, plum jam, and just a hint of thyme—wraps around you like a velvet cloak the moment you step inside.  Behind the glass counter: rows of perfect, gleaming pastries arranged with near-military precision. Nothing is labeled. You are expected to *know.*  <br><br>**Owner:** [[Céline Aravel]], a middle-aged elf with silver-streaked hair pulled into a bun so tight it could slice fruit. She gestures instead of greeting, sighs instead of answering, and offers a 10% discount—wordlessly—if you mention *Dr. Bixby Wizzlethorpe*. She still won't smile. But the pear-saffron galette might change your life.<br> |
