![[Blacktide Swamp_89a4e268.webp]]

A foreboding marshland shrouded in perpetual mist, **Blacktide Swamp** is a cursed place of sinister reputation, whispered about only in hushed tones. The swamp has long since been tainted by dark magic, drawing in corrupted creatures, lost souls, and those who seek refuge from the outside world. 

Its **murky waters** conceal lurking dangers—venomous serpents, unseen predators, and creatures twisted by the swamp's lingering curse. The air is thick with the **stench of decay**, and the distant echoes of guttural chants often ripple through the gloom, hinting at the **cultists and dark beings** that call this place home. Those who enter without caution may find themselves ensnared in illusions or caught in traps laid by those who thrive in the swamp's eerie depths.  

At the heart of the marsh lies a place of true horror—the ruined hut of the [Margatha Blacktide](../NPCs/margatha_blacktide.md), an ancient Green Hag, [recently defeated](../story/act_1/session_3.md) by heroes of Southaven. Hidden by potent illusions, it was the site of wicked bargains and gruesome rituals, where stolen children were held captive and foul magics brewed. Though the hag was slain, her influence lingers, and the swamp remains a treacherous place, where shadows move unnaturally and the water whispers secrets to those who dare to listen.  

Even in the wake of her death, the swamp remains a dark place, and the deeper mysteries of Blacktide Swamp remain untouched.
