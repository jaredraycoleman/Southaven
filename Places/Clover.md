## Description

Clover is a large halfling settlement—more akin to a city than a village, though its residents would never call it such—nestled along the banks of the [[River Elryn]] (known to halflings as The Windy River). Its charming round-door homes are built into gentle hillsides and clustered around cobblestone squares filled with flower gardens, market stalls, and cozy taverns. Despite its size, Clover maintains a peaceful, unhurried atmosphere, where the clatter of wagon wheels and the laughter of children echo through tree-lined streets. The settlement sits about 30 miles south of [[Brandyburrow]], connected by well-worn trade paths that wind through rolling farmland and orchards.

## Background

Clover serves as a major trading hub for the halfling villages west of the [[Dragonspire Mountains]], drawing merchants from [[Brandyburrow]], [[Cobblefoot]], and even distant [[Solaris]]. The river provides fresh water and a natural trade route for small barges carrying grain, wool, and crafted goods downstream.
