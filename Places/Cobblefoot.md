## Description

Cobblefoot is a modest halfling village situated along the [[River Elryn]], about 30 miles southwest of [[Clover]]. Unlike the purely halfling settlements to the north, Cobblefoot is home to a small but growing population of humans and dwarves who left the bustle of cities like [[Solaris]] and [[Southaven]] in search of a simpler, more peaceful life. The village features a mix of architectural styles: traditional halfling round-door homes built into hillsides sit alongside sturdy human cottages and dwarven stone workshops. A single stone bridge arches gracefully over the river, connecting the village's two halves, and the air is filled with the sounds of hammering, baking, and the gentle rush of water.

## Background

Cobblefoot has become known as a haven for those seeking respite from the chaos of the wider world. Its mixed population brings diverse skills and traditions, creating a unique community where halfling hospitality blends with human ambition and dwarven craftsmanship.
