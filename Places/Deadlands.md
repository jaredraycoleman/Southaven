## Description

The Deadlands is a vast, desolate region east of the [[Pale Mountains]], scarred by the ancient war against [[Taelkor]]. The land bears the marks of devastation—cracked earth, twisted rock formations, and patches where nothing grows except scrub brush and thorny weeds. Dust devils dance across barren plains, and the air shimmers with heat during the day while freezing at night. [[Lusteris]] stands in the north as the only widely known city in the region, a cosmopolitan beacon of survival amid the wasteland. The silence here is profound, broken only by the wind howling through broken ravines and the occasional cry of a carrion bird circling overhead.

## DM Notes

While [[Lusteris]] is the only known city, there are other settlements hidden in the southern Deadlands, particularly around [[Khasim's Crown]] and east of the [[Witchwood]]. These communities have survived in secret, adapting to the harsh conditions and learning to thrive where others see only ruin. The party will discover these settlements later in the campaign.
