Donavar Reddmark's safehouse is a **two-story home** located in the noble district of [Southaven](Southaven.md), blending seamlessly with the opulent residences of wealthy merchants and dignitaries. Built from **dark timber and stone**, its polished exterior suggests refinement, but beneath the surface, it serves as a hub for smuggling, extortion, and clandestine dealings.  

Inside, the house is **fortified and meticulously organized**, designed to provide both comfort and security. The first floor is a **gathering space** for Donavar's enforcers, with a **hidden escape tunnel** in the cellar. The second floor houses Donavar's **personal quarters and a secure holding room**, where Brenlan Kael is currently being kept under guard. The top floor features a **private study and hidden safes**, containing records of smuggling routes and coded messages to the Black Star cultists.  

The safehouse is heavily **guarded and rigged with traps**, ensuring that only those who belong can navigate its halls unscathed. **Thick curtains** keep prying eyes from peering in, and **hidden peepholes** allow Donavar to watch the street below. Though it appears like any other noble home, those who step inside quickly realize—it is a den of secrets, where every shadow hides a knife.
