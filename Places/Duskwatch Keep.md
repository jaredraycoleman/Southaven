**Duskwatch**, once known as **Valengarde Citadel**, stands as a forgotten sentinel in the heart of the **Pale Mountains**. This ancient keep's front gates stand ominously at the base of Valengarde mountain with rocky cliffs, a ghostly reminder of its former glory as a thriving mithril mine. The citadel was a marvel of engineering, built into the mountain itself, featuring a grand entrance flanked by high stone walls and fortified towers that jut out precariously from the mountain face.

Upon the discovery of mithril in the dark veins of the surrounding rock, the site grew from a simple mining operation into an impressive citadel that attracted miners, traders, and artisans alike. Feats of dwarven ingenuity and craftsmanship transformed the active mine into a bastion of commerce, with bustling markets and great halls echoing with laughter and trade. However, the citadel's prosperity waned mysteriously almost a thousand years ago, resulting in its abandonment and a slow fade from the memories of those in the valleys below.

## Description

Now, **Duskwatch** is cloaked in an aura of forlorn majesty, shrouded in mist. The once-bustling corridors are now cold and silent, filled with a haunting atmosphere where time seems to have stood still. Crumbling masonry, scavenged by nature, interspersed with dwarven artifacts and tools reflects both the brilliance of its past and the tragedy of its downfall.

At the entrance, a large, intricately carved gate opens into shadowy depths, where flickers of light might occasionally dance along the walls, suggesting that the remains of ancient magic linger within. The upper entrance, a treacherous path that winds along a narrow ridge, offers a perilous ascent, serving as a reminder of the citadel's formidable defenses.
