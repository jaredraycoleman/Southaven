The Elfwood is a vast and ancient forest stretching from the mist-wreathed [[Dragonspire Mountains]] in the west to the icy peaks of the [[Pale Mountains]] in the east, its northern edge fading into the desolate Deadlands. Though its name evokes elven grace, the forest shelters a diverse array of peoples and creatures beneath its emerald canopy. Sun-dappled glades and silver rivers wind between towering trees older than recorded history, their roots entwined with forgotten ruins and quiet magic. At its heart lies [[Vel Enweir]], the radiant realm of [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]], whose capital, [[Balandel]], gleams like a dream of perfection amid the green. Far to the west, the city of [[Fadrín]] clings to the lower slopes of the Dragonspires, where trade, mountain wind, and elven song mingle in equal measure.
