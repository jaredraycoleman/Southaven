![[The Ember Halls_73c6b085.webp]]

Carved deep into the roots of the **Pale Mountains**, the **Ember Halls** are the beating heart of dwarven culture and craft. The city stretches through vast caverns lit by the glow of molten rivers, with colossal stone pillars carved into likenesses of ancient kings and heroes. The air is hot and heavy with the scent of forge-smoke and stone, alive with the rhythmic thunder of hammers echoing from the lava-fueled forges. Every hall gleams with the work of dwarven hands—walls inlaid with veins of gold and mithril, floors polished to a volcanic sheen, and great gates wrought of steel so thick they seem unbreakable.

The forges themselves are legendary: titanic workshops powered by channels of flowing magma, where smiths work with fire hotter than the sun and metal is shaped into wonders unseen elsewhere in the world. Above them, the **Hall of Flames** serves as both a temple and assembly, where the Firewardens keep eternal pyres burning in honor of the forge-gods and ancestors.

Though the Ember Halls are a fortress-city, life flourishes here. Markets bustle with merchants trading gems, iron, and carved stone, while feasting halls roar with laughter, song, and the clatter of tankards raised in defiance of hardship. Yet beneath the revelry lies tension: goblin warbands grow bold in the mountains, the deep tunnels collapse with unsettling frequency, and whispers spread of older, darker things stirring far below.

At the city’s core lies the **Throne of Ash and Iron**, where **King Brundrik Stonebluff** rules with steady hand and weary heart, carrying the burdens of both crown and clan. To his people, the Ember Halls are more than a home—they are a bastion of fire and stone, standing against the shadows of the deep.
