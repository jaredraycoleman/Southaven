![[Fadrín_0aab8fce.webp]]

High on the slopes of the Eastern [[Dragonspire Mountains]], nestled where pine forests brush against stone cliffs, lies the elven town of Fadrín. Unlike their kin of the deep [[Elfwood]], the elves of Fadrín are marked by their striking blue-hued skin, a trait said to be born from generations of mountain air, starlight, and the icy streams that carve through their home. Their presence gives the town a dreamlike quality—figures of sapphire and indigo moving with quiet grace beneath the green canopy and gray stone.

Fadrín itself blends seamlessly into its surroundings. Houses of pale wood and mountain stone cling to terraces cut into the slope, with crystal streams winding through their gardens. Lanterns of silvered glass glow softly at night, casting light like starlight upon the cobbled paths. From the higher terraces, the valleys stretch endlessly below, while the jagged peaks of the Dragonspires loom above, veiled in mist.

The people of Fadrín are known for their warmth and hospitality, though they carry themselves with the serene patience of the mountain winds. They are skilled in songcraft, weaving, and guiding travelers through the dangerous high passes, often seen as guardians of the border where forest and mountain meet. Though smaller and quieter than the great cities of the Elfwood, Fadrín is revered for its beauty, harmony, and the otherworldly grace of its blue-skinned folk.

## Shopping District

Fadrín's marketplace cascades down several terraces connected by stone stairways, where crystal streams flow through carved channels beside the cobbled paths. The blue-skinned mountain elves offer their wares in shops built of pale wood and mountain stone, each establishment a testament to their craftsmanship and connection to the peaks above.
