## Description

Giant's Lake is a massive body of water at the southern end of [[Windcrest Valley]], its surface stretching for miles like a vast mirror reflecting the sky and the towering [[Mount Kraknor]] to the east. The lake's waters are deep and cold, fed by snowmelt from the [[Pale Mountains]], and its shores are lined with ancient pines and rocky beaches. True to its name, giants are known to descend from [[Mount Kraknor]]—a towering peak that rises dramatically from the beginning of the mountain range like a lonely sentinel—to drink from the lake's waters and fish in its depths. The sight of a giant wading through the shallows, silhouetted against the sunset, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.

## Background

Local settlements keep their distance from Giant's Lake, knowing that the giants who dwell in and around [[Mount Kraknor]] consider the lake their territory. Travelers who pass through the area do so quietly and respectfully, leaving offerings of food or crafted goods on the shore to avoid provoking the giants' wrath. Despite the danger, the lake is a source of fresh water and abundant fish for those brave—or desperate—enough to approach its shores.
