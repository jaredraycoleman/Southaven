## Description

The Hellrock Hills rise west of [[Southaven]] like a labyrinth of stone, a sprawling maze of towering brown Metamorphosed volcanic rock and biotite monzogranite formations weathered into twisted spires, narrow passages, and hidden canyons. The hills earned their name from the ruddy, iron-rich stone that glows like smoldering embers in the light of dawn and dusk, and from the treacherous paths that wind through their depths—easy to enter, difficult to escape. Wind howls through the stone corridors with an eerie wail, and the terrain shifts from sun-baked plateaus to shadowed ravines where even experienced scouts can lose their way.

The Hellrock Hills have long been a haven for bandits and outlaws who use the natural fortifications to establish camps and hideouts. Deep within the maze of stone lies Fort Hellrock, a ruined fortress that [[Varnek the Scarred]] has transformed into his stronghold, coordinating the bandit forces that now emerge from the hills to raid the countryside and blockade [[Southaven]].

## DM Notes
- Inspired by Alabama Hills - a maze of rounded boulders and rock formations, but much larger scale
- Multiple bandit camps throughout, but Fort Hellrock is the main stronghold
- The party will need to navigate the confusing terrain while dealing with patrols and ambushes
- The natural maze makes it easy for bandits to escape and regroup
