The Last Light Church is on the western edge of the witchwood, just past one of the last settlements that mostly houses the Witchguard members (Solaran soldiers who patrol the western border of the witchwood to keep its darkness at bay) and their families. This church was dedicated to [[Church of Elandria#Saint Calros, Patron of Truth|Saint Calros, Patron of Truth]].

This church is a front for [[Vaelith]] worshippers, who have been banned in Solaris (along with [[Nytheris]] and [[Zareen]] worshippers). This place is particularly sacred. It is a temple of death, where Vaelites volunteer to be sacrificed and brought back to life as extremely life-like undead creatures called the "deathless". It is considered a great honor to go through this process, as those who do get a glimpse at Vaelith's dark and heavenly domain. The [[Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star]] has taken over some of these temples and is using this process to create deathless warriors under their control. 

The temple can be accessed through a secret door behind the altar.
