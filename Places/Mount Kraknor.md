## Description

Mount Kraknor is a towering mountain that rises dramatically from the southern edge of the [[Pale Mountains]], standing so tall and isolated that it appears to be a solitary giant among the foothills. Its snow-capped peak pierces the clouds, visible for hundreds of miles across [[Windcrest Valley]], and its slopes are steep and treacherous, carved by ancient glaciers and avalanches. The mountain is shrouded in legend and fear, for it is said that giants make their home within its heights—dwelling in vast caves carved into the rock or in crude fortresses built from boulders the size of houses. Few dare to climb its slopes, and fewer still return to tell the tale.

## Background

Mount Kraknor is the home of the giants who occasionally descend to [[Giant's Lake]] at the mountain's base. Stories speak of a giant king or chieftain who rules from a throne of ice and stone deep within the mountain's heart, though no one knows if such tales are true. The mountain's name is spoken with reverence and caution throughout [[Windcrest Valley]], a reminder that not all the land's dangers come from cultists or bandits—some are older, larger, and far more primal.
