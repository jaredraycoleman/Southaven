![[Myrlen'Thal, The Grove of Morning_0d36a41e.webp]]

Bathed eternally in golden light, Myrlen'Thal feels like the world's first breath after dawn. Its trees shimmer with pale leaves that glow softly, even in shadow, and birdsong echoes with unnatural harmony. It is a place of radiant life and joyful renewal, where new growth springs from every fallen leaf. Pilgrims come seeking hope and beginnings, and the druids here speak often of cycles of birth, blossoming, and the sacred promise of the sun's return.
