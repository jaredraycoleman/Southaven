## Description

Opal Lake is a pristine mountain lake nestled high in the [[Dragonspire Mountains]], just north of [[Brandyburrow]]. Its waters shimmer with an iridescent quality—shifting between blues, greens, and subtle purples depending on the light and angle—which earned it the name "Opal." Fed by snowmelt and mountain springs, the lake's waters are crystal-clear and icy cold, so pure that you can see straight to the rocky bottom even in its deepest parts. Ancient pines ring the shoreline, and mist often clings to the surface at dawn, creating an ethereal atmosphere that feels almost otherworldly. The lake serves as the primary source for the [[River Elryn]], which flows down from the mountains to nourish the halfling settlements below.

## Background

Opal Lake is considered sacred by many of the halflings who live in [[Brandyburrow]] and the villages along the [[River Elryn]]. Local legend claims the lake's unusual coloration comes from veins of magical crystal deep beneath its surface, though no one has been brave enough to dive deep enough to confirm. The area around the lake is peaceful and unspoiled, visited primarily by hunters, fishermen, and those seeking quiet contemplation.
