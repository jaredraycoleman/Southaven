## Description

The River Elryn—affectionately called The Windy River by the halflings who live along its banks—flows from the heights of the [[Dragonspire Mountains]] and the pristine [[Opal Lake]] near [[Brandyburrow]]. It meanders southward through rolling hills and farmland, passing through halfling villages like [[Clover]] and [[Cobblefoot]] before eventually reaching the coast. The river is fed by countless mountain streams, and its waters run clear and cold, twisting and turning through the landscape in gentle, unpredictable curves that earned it its halfling name.

## Background

The River Elryn serves as a vital lifeline for the halfling settlements west of the [[Dragonspire Mountains]], providing fresh water, irrigation for crops, and a means of transporting goods via small barges and rafts.
