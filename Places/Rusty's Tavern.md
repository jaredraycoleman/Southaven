![[Rusty's Tavern_0dbaa70e.webp]]

Perched atop the central hill of Southaven, **Rusty's Tavern**, owned by the charismatic [[Rusty Ironbelly]], is a well-worn yet welcoming establishment that has stood the test of time. As the **oldest inn in Southaven**, it has watched the town grow from a modest trading post into the bustling waypoint it is today. Recently purchased by Rusty, the tavern has been lovingly restored and expanded to accommodate the growing number of travelers and adventurers passing through. Its prime location - nestled close to the keep - makes it not just a favorite among travelers but also a hotspot for merchants, town officials, and adventurers seeking refuge after long journeys along The Road.  

The tavern's exterior is built of sturdy timber and stone, its large oak doors flanked by iron sconces that glow warmly in the evening. A massive iron belly-shaped sign, engraved with the likeness of a laughing dwarf and a foaming mug, swings gently in the wind. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of roasting meats, spiced ale, and the rich, smoky aroma of dwarven whiskey. Thick wooden beams line the ceiling, and the walls are adorned with old maps, mounted weapons, and faded banners - tokens of Rusty's past adventures and gifts from the many patrons who have passed through his doors.  

Despite its higher cost, Rusty's Tavern is more than just a place to rest; it is **Southaven's beating heart**, a gathering place where deals are struck, stories are shared, and old friends reunite. The common room is alive with laughter, music from wandering bards, and the occasional heated debate over a game of dice or cards. Rusty himself presides over it all, his booming voice carrying above the din as he pours drinks, shares tales, and keeps the peace.  

For those who can afford a night's stay, the inn offers **comfortable private rooms**, each with a sturdy lock and thick woolen blankets to keep out the valley's chill. The famed **"Ironbelly Suite"**, named after Rusty himself, is the most luxurious accommodation in Southaven, boasting a large feathered bed, a private hearth, and a balcony overlooking the town square.  

More than just a place of business, **Rusty's Tavern is a sanctuary**, where weary travelers find warmth, strong ale, and a sense of belonging. Whether you're a merchant seeking a profitable deal, an adventurer nursing wounds from the road, or a rogue looking for whispers of the town's latest intrigues, Rusty's is always open - so long as you can pay the tab.
