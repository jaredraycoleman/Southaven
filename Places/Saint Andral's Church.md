![[Saint Andral's Church_ed72c52b.webp]]
 
> A small, humble chapel to [[Elandria]], the Lady of Light, Saint Andral's sits a few hours ride outside of [[Balandel]] just outside of [[Vel Enweir]], the Queen's holy realm. Its single nave is narrow, with worn oak pews and walls whitewashed but cracked in places. A pair of tall, simple windows let in pale light, and the only ornament of note is a carved sunburst above the modest altar. A faint smell of smoke and bread lingers — from the tiny kitchen hearth just behind the sanctuary, where the priest cooks both his meals and the offerings of the faithful.

The priest lives in a **single small room** tucked behind the altar: a narrow bed, a desk covered with wax-stained prayer scrolls, and a chest at the foot of the bed containing vestments patched more often than replaced.

Beneath the chapel lies the cellar, damp and cool, where St. Andral’s tomb rests: a plain stone sarcophagus marked only with Elandria’s sigil and the words, “Mercy is Light.” The air is thick with dust, and the space is more storeroom than shrine, lined with a few casks of ale and jars of dried fruit. But those who kneel before the tomb sometimes report a curious warmth or a sudden sense of peace — as though Andral still listens.

## Who Was St. Andral?

Saint Andral of Dawnfire was a healer during the First War. Stories say he walked the battlefields not with a blade but with an open hand, tending the wounded of both sides. He once spared an orc commander who later betrayed his mercy, leading to Andral's death — yet it was this act of mercy that convinced his own people to honor him as a saint. To Elandria's faithful, he is a patron of compassion, forgiveness, and second chances, and his tomb became a site of pilgrimage for the downtrodden, though it is little visited today.

## Story

When Dravencoles visits the tomb, he feels a presence — not a voice, but a weighing. The stone warms under his touch, and for a heartbeat, the sound of his own pulse echoes like a distant bell. He sees an image in his mind: [[Talan Windfern]]'s face, terrified, and his own gauntleted hand raised to strike.

Then, faintly, the words seem to hang in the silence:  
“Mercy is Light. Without it, even the brightest flame burns hollow.”

If he lingers, the warmth spreads into his chest, granting him a **one-time boon**: advantage on his next saving throw against corruption, wrath, or an effect that would push him to violence. But the weight remains — a reminder that his actions are being measured against the creed of mercy.
