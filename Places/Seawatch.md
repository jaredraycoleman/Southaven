**Seawatch** is Solara’s most beautiful city, a gleaming port perched on white cliffs above the western sea. Though not the capital—that honor belongs to [[Solaris]]—it is the kingdom’s grandest harbor and cultural jewel, where cascading fountains, marble terraces, and golden-domed towers overlook bustling markets and crowded docks. Merchant ships from across the world sail toward its ever-burning lighthouse, while nobles and travelers alike celebrate Seawatch as the shining crown of Solara’s coast.
