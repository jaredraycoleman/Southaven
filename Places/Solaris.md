![[Solaris_98f08087.webp]]

The beating heart of the kingdom, Solaris is a city of sunlit grandeur built along the golden coast where the Azure River meets the sea. Its marble walls and sweeping avenues radiate outward from the Sunspire Palace, a towering citadel crowned with a spire of crystal that catches the dawn and scatters it in a thousand dazzling rays. Where Seawatch is known for beauty and indulgence, Solaris is a city of power and permanence—the capital where crown, council, and temple unite.

The streets of Solaris bustle with life at all hours. Broad boulevards shaded by citrus trees and lined with statues of kings past lead to great plazas where heralds proclaim decrees and bards sing the kingdom’s triumphs. Temples to the gods rise in harmonious rows along the Dawnward Quarter, their bells pealing across the rooftops. At its heart, Solaris is both fortress and beacon: a city that embodies the weight of Solara’s legacy and the brightness of its ambitions.
