![[Solaris_98f08087.webp]]

The beating heart of the kingdom, Solaris is a city of sunlit grandeur built along the golden coast where the Azure River meets the sea. Its marble walls and sweeping avenues radiate outward from the Sunspire Palace, a towering citadel crowned with a spire of crystal that catches the dawn and scatters it in a thousand dazzling rays. Where Seawatch is known for beauty and indulgence, Solaris is a city of power and permanence—the capital where crown, council, and temple unite.

The streets of Solaris bustle with life at all hours. Broad boulevards shaded by citrus trees and lined with statues of kings past lead to great plazas where heralds proclaim decrees and bards sing the kingdom's triumphs. Temples to the gods rise in harmonious rows along the Dawnward Quarter, their bells pealing across the rooftops. At its heart, Solaris is both fortress and beacon: a city that embodies the weight of Solara's legacy and the brightness of its ambitions.

## The Undercroft

Beneath the marble façades and sunlit plazas lies Solaris's thriving underground scene—a network of shadowed alleys, basement taverns, and forgotten tunnels known collectively as the Undercroft. Here, the city's outcasts, artists, criminals, and rebels mingle in a world the nobility pretends doesn't exist. The relationship between the Undercroft and the powers above is complex: the government tolerates it as long as it stays hidden, the nobility secretly patronizes it for forbidden pleasures, and the [[Church of Elandria]] walks a careful line—offering aid to the poor and lost while condemning the crime that festers in the darkness.

Most who dwell in the Undercroft still worship [[Elandria]], attending services in crumbling chapels lit by stolen candles. But other faiths have taken root here too—small shrines to [[Nytheris]] in gambling dens, whispered prayers to forgotten gods in hidden corners. It's a place of contradictions: danger and community, vice and survival, shadows and a strange kind of freedom.
