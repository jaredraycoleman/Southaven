![[Southaven Library_42086259.webp]]

The Southaven Library is a small yet treasured institution, nestled in the heart of its quiet medieval town. Built of warm stone and aged wood, its ivy-covered walls and stained-glass windows give it a timeless charm. Inside, towering shelves hold a carefully curated collection, made all the richer by its unique circulation agreements with the grand libraries of Solara Lusteris, and even the elven capital of Balandél. Soft candlelight flickers over plush reading nooks and sturdy wooden desks, where scholars, adventurers, and townsfolk alike pore over rare tomes and whispered histories. Though modest in size, the library serves as a gateway to a world of knowledge, its welcoming atmosphere making it a cherished refuge for all who seek wisdom. The library is currently run by [Roswin Brambletoe](../NPCs/roswin_brambletoe.md) and guarded by [Borg](Borg.md).
