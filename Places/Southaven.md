Southaven is a bustling town of around 2,000 people, nestled in the [[Windcrest Valley]] and serving as the largest settlement for hundreds of miles in any direction. Positioned along The Road, a vital trade route that connects the grand metropolis of **Solara** to the south and the desert city of [[Lusteris]] in the north, Southaven is a common stop for travelers, traders, and adventurers alike. Its strategic location below the Elfwood, east of the Dragonspire Mountains, and west of the Pale Mountains makes it a key waypoint for those journeying between diverse regions, providing supplies, rest, and information. Despite its remote setting, Southaven thrives as a hub of commerce, culture, and intrigue, linking two vastly different worlds.

The area surrounding Southaven is diverse and full of contrasts. To the south lies [[Solaris]], a sprawling coastal metropolis known for its wealth, trade, and strong monarchy. Westward, beyond the towering Dragonspire Mountains, a series of peaceful halfling villages dot the rolling hills, isolated from the bustling trade routes. To the north past the serene Elfwood and east of the Pale Mountains, stretches an expansive. [[Lusteris]] is the only major settlement in the desert, a city-state republic where all races and religions coexist, though it's notorious for corrupt politicians, rampant crime, and thriving underworld activities. Despite its harsh desert surroundings, [[Lusteris]] is a bustling, cosmopolitan hub, in stark contrast to the tranquil villages and forested regions to the south.

Southaven's architecture blends rustic medieval and frontier practicality, with timber and stone buildings built to endure the harsh, mountainous environment. Sloped thatched or shingled roofs, large hearths, and sturdy stone foundations reflect the need for warmth and durability. Cobblestone streets and simple, functional designs emphasize the town's hardworking, communal spirit, while defensive walls and watchtowers speak to the dangers of the surrounding wilderness. The overall aesthetic is rugged yet inviting, a blend of humble craftsmanship and natural charm.
