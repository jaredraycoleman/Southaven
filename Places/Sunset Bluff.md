## Description

Sunset Bluff is a small human settlement perched on the windswept cliffs overlooking the western sea, about 80 miles west of [[Seawatch]] and 50 miles southwest of [[Cobblefoot]]. The village consists of sturdy timber and stone buildings clustered around a natural harbor, where fishing boats bob in the tide and gulls cry overhead. True to its name, the settlement is famous for its breathtaking sunsets, when the sky blazes orange and pink over the endless horizon, casting the white cliffs in golden light. The air tastes of salt and sea spray, and the constant sound of waves crashing against the rocks below creates a rhythmic backdrop to daily life.

## Background

Sunset Bluff survives primarily on fishing and small-scale trade with passing ships. Its remote location keeps it isolated from the major conflicts and politics of [[Windcrest Valley]], though travelers and merchants occasionally stop here to resupply before continuing north to [[Seawatch]] or south along the coast.
