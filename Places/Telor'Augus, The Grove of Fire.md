![[Telor'Augus, The Grove of Fire_2dd8dcf0.webp]]

Mirror-pools and crystalline springs dot this high, wind-swept grove, where the air always smells faintly of ash and rain. The flames that burn here, often in floating lanterns or sacred braziers, are not wild but deeply meditative, tended with reverence. Telor'Augus represents cleansing, transformation, and the pain required for true change. Many druids come here alone, seeking visions in the reflection of water and flame alike. It is a place where ego burns away.
