The arboretum is a well-known dining establishment in [[Balandel]] known for its home-made brews, wines, and liqueurs. The Arboretum's owner, [[Serelion Vael]] also owns the Scarlet Shield Tavern, the only tavern in Balandel open to strangers that do not have city passes.

The Arboretum secretly has long smuggled contraband in and out of [[The Balandel Prison]], purely as a money-making side-hustle. Lately, though, cultists have taken advantage of the underground tunnels (unbeknownst to Serelion Vael), to smuggle cultists and other items in and out of the lower and upper city (the prison being in the lower city and the arboretum in the upper city).
