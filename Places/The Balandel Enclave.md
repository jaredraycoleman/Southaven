The Balandel Enclave is where ambassadors from [[Vel Enweir]]'s druids of [[The Circle of Verdant Flame]] congregate to make communicate and make decisions. The three most important ambassadors are [[Serelion Thorneweave]] (ambassador to [[Telor'Augus, The Grove of Fire]]), [[Irielle Duskwhisper]] (ambassador to [[Shael'Nareth, The Grove of Twilight]]), and [[Sylvara Greenthorn]] (ambassador to [[Myrlen'Thal, The Grove of Morning]]). Each of these ambassadors has is actually a [[Order of the Black Star|Black Star cultist]] that killed the real ambassador and replaced them in the enclave. They are the ones who have gained knowledge of [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]]'s Ring of Verdant Stillness that keep [[Vel Enweir]] in a pristine and perfect state. They are plotting to take and destroy the ring to weaken the elves for a later attack.

The enclave operates out of the Temple to [[The Pantheon#Faeren, God of Nature and Balance|Faeren, God of Nature and Balance]].
