On their first day adventuring together, the party found a cultist hideout while investigating missing townsfolk for [[Lord Elrin Kael]]. The hideout was located in a cave system just outside of Southaven, and harbored a group of cultists kidnapping and sacrificing people for a purpose yet unknown. The party found a map with two other locations marked on it: the [Southaven Mines](The%20Southaven%20Mines.md) and [Blacktide Swamp](Blacktide%20Swamp.md).
