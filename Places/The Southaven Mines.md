The Southaven Mines are a major part of the [[Southaven]] economy, providing jobs and resources for the local community. The mines are located in the hills to the north of Southaven, and are accessible by a network of roads and railways. After seeing the mines marked on a cultist map, the party investigated them and found bandits had been using a section of the mines as a base of operations. They also found an echoing shard, one of the ingredients [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe]] asked them to keep an eye out for, in a dark abandonded section.
