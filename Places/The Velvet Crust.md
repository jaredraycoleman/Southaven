Tucked between a perfumery and a bookshop that refuses to alphabetize, **The Velvet Crust** is a narrow little patisserie with deep red awnings and frosted-glass windows etched in swirling, floury runes. The smell—warm butter, plum jam, and just a hint of thyme—wraps around you like a velvet cloak the moment you step inside.

Behind the glass counter: rows of perfect, gleaming pastries arranged with near-military precision. Nothing is labeled. You are expected to _know_.

The proprietor, [[Céline Aravel]], is a middle-aged elf with silver-streaked hair pulled into a bun so tight it could slice fruit. She does not greet you. She gestures. If you ask too many questions, she sighs audibly. But mention [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe]], and her brows lift exactly one millimeter.

She still won't smile. But your pear-saffron galette will be discounted (10%), and it will be the best damn thing you've tasted in three cities.
