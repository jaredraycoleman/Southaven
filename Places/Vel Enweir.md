![[Vel Enweir_7f07ac8c.webp]]

A realm of luminous forests and timeless serenity, Vel Enweir is the most radiant expanse of the [[Elfwood]] and the domain of [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]]. Here, towering silverwood trees stretch skyward like living spires, their leaves shimmering with hues of gold and emerald that never fade, even in winter. Sunlight filters through the canopy in cascading beams, caught by crystal streams and mirrored across still pools that scatter rainbows into the air. The very land seems to breathe with quiet harmony, untouched by the chaos of the outside world.

At the heart of Vel Enweir lies **Balandel**, the capital—a city woven seamlessly into the silverwoods, its halls suspended among branches and waterfalls. Around it, elven villages rest in groves of flowering trees, connected by airy bridges, lantern-lit paths, and songs carried on the wind. Peace here is not fragile but enduring, guarded by druids, spell-singers, and wardens who walk unseen beneath the leaves.

To mortals from beyond the forest, Vel Enweir feels like a dream: an eternal twilight of beauty and wonder, where time itself seems gentler. It is a sanctuary of light, wisdom, and grace—a reflection of elven immortality, and the crown jewel of the Elfwood.

### The Three Great Groves

These groves are sacred sites tied directly to the magic of the land—and to the Ring of Verdant Stillness.

1. [[Myrlen'Thal, The Grove of Morning]]
    Located northeast of Balandel, this grove is always bathed in golden light, regardless of cloud or season. It is said the first sunrise after the First War broke here.
2. [[Shael'Nareth, The Grove of Twilight]]
    To the south, the trees here are darker, older. The grove hums with old magic, and the boundary between the Feywild and the material world grows thin. This is where the Queen is said to go when she needs solitude.
3. [[Telor'Augus, The Grove of Fire]]
    Near the eastern border, this grove contains crystalline springs and mirror-pools. Pilgrims often come here to meditate.
