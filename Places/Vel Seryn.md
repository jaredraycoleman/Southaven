![[Vel Seryn_328c02fe.webp]]

Buried deep within the [[Dragonspire Mountains]], Vel Seryn was once a radiant bastion of resistance in the First War, where dwarves, men, and elves forged a rare alliance against [[Taelkor]], the Unmaker. Hewn almost entirely inside the mountain itself, its cavernous halls were lit by enchanted crystals and rivers of molten stone, its fortifications raised by dwarven masons, its wards woven by elven magisters, and its armies led by human generals. For a time, Vel Seryn stood as the last and greatest fortress of unity in an age defined by despair.

But when the war turned, the city fell—how or why is lost to history. Some whisper of betrayal, others of divine abandonment, but all agree on one truth: Vel Seryn vanished. Its gates sealed, its name forgotten, its memory swallowed by the mountain’s silence.

Today, the city survives only in fragments: a half-line in an old chronicle, a faded sigil in a ruined chapel, a whispered song among the elves. Even many scholars dismiss it as legend. Yet a few, poring over hidden texts, claim that the mountain itself still guards Vel Seryn, its echoing chambers locked away in shadow, waiting to be rediscovered.
