## Original Description

The arboretum is a well-known dining establishment in Balandel known for its home-made brews, wines, and liqueurs. The Arboretum's owner, Serelion Vael also owns the Scarlet Shield Tavern, the only tavern in Balandel open to strangers that do not have city passes.

The Arboretum secretly has long smuggled contraband in and out of The Balandel Prison, purely as a money-making side-hustle. Lately, though, cultists have taken advantage of the underground tunnels (unbeknownst to Serelion Vael), to smuggle cultists and other items in and out of the lower and upper city (the prison being in the lower city and the arboretum in the upper city).

## Refined Description

The arboretum dining establishment is nestled within a lush, enclosed garden teeming with verdant foliage. A cobblestone path winds through beds of fragrant herbs and vibrant flowers, leading to a rustic, wooden building whose walls are partially hidden by climbing ivy. The warm, golden glow from lanterns hanging on the building and along the path casts a welcoming light. Inside, large, paned windows bring in ample daylight, and patrons can sit at wooden tables polished to a rich sheen. Bottles of homemade brews, wines, and liqueurs are neatly arranged on shelves behind a sturdy bar, where a variety of colorful glassware sparkles. The ceiling is high, with wooden beams overhead, and potted plants hanging or placed strategically around to create a natural, serene ambiance. The air is filled with the rich, mixed scents of wine, spices, and fresh foliage.
