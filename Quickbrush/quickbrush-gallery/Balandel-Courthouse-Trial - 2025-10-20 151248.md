**Original Description:**

Queen Aelra Sylanthiel has been accused of Archdruid Thalwen Myr of using "necromantic" magic to sustain Vel Enweir in eternal beauty by draining the druid groves Shael'Nareth, The Grove of Twilight, Telor'Augus, The Grove of Fire, and Myrlen'Thal, The Grove of Morning. The Archdruid attacked, but Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria convinced her to stop and instead hold a trial.

After the party saved the groves, Archdruid Thalwen Myr promised to interrogate a cultist leader (Malrec) she had captured and find out the reason for the attack. Through brutal, fiery torture, she extracted the location of the cultist's nearby operating center. After raiding the center, she found a few notes of interest:
A note from Myhran, the cultist running operations in Balandel from the Crypt of House Vaelrin that the party killed. The note says everything is going well, but that the ring does not exist and to stand down for now. The note is the one the party modified in Session 17 - Echoes Beneath the Crypt.
A scrambled note from Lyrian Brightwind|Lyrian to Velara Kael|Velara that has not been decrypted yet. 

> Ihrr ygw fmjcgrk. Lbrj pw ulrx. Wbbe Adas. V ent u Ixdprn.

which translates, with the keyword "pants" to:

> They grw strnger. Tmrw we flee. Embr Hlls. I lve u Velara.

A note from Serelion Thorneweave to Malrec:

> Malrec,
> 
> The Ring of Verdant Stillness is real. I cannot fathom why Myrhan told you otherwise, but your doubts are wasted time. We cannot hope to take Balandel while the Queen wears it. Accelerate your work at the groves—break them, and her strength will falter. You are to launch a full assault on the penultimate day of July.
> 
> The heroes complicate matters. They struck down Myrhan, yet his death may serve us—he was careless. Already, the boy he trained shows dangerous promise. To raise his sister and her lover with scarcely a month's discipline… volatile, yes, but perhaps the storm we require. I will keep him close.
> 
> The witch is gone, another victim of these meddling heroes. Inconvenient, but not crippling. Far more troubling is the rescue of the Sylvenblade child. She is Balandel-born and dreams true. She must be eliminated. This will be a good test for the boy.
> 
> —Serelion


NPC Involvement

Both the Archdruid and the Queen will try to get the party on their side. Other characters that could be convinced to testify, provide evidence, etc. are:

Talan Windfern: Wrongly accused of being involved in the cultist plans by the party (they think he is the "boy" that the cultists in the cave behind the prison were referring to but it is actually Jesse Durn), he may reveal information about what he went through, the party's activity, etc.

Tilly Thistle|Tilly and Finnathan Thistle|Finn Thistle: They may be interrogated on what they're doing in Balandel, their relationship with the party, the party's activities, future plans, etc. Their default will be to tell the truth.

Velara Kael: Will also be interrogated on the party. She doesn't like the Queen very much (after being falsely accused of killing her high adviser), and leans toward taking the druid's side. She will do whatever the party asks her to, though.

Garrin Dace may be interrogated about the party's activities. He owes them, though, for saving him against the revenant Melissa Vaelrin. News has spread about his being responsible for the killing of the Vaelrin's, though, and he is hated throughout Balandel.

Céline Aravel, Bixby Wizzlethorpe|Bixby, and the rest of the Shopping district NPCs may be interrogated as well.

Calenhir Sylvenblade's daughter Laerwen Sylvenblade is mentioned in the note as an assassination target. The Archdruid is trying to keep this secret. She has assigned two druids of the flame to monitor the Sylvenblade's home. She hopes to use this to draw them out.

Queen Aelra Sylanthiel will try to get the party on her side. She is confined to her estate, but offers one of the twin orbs of passage to the party to maintain a communication channel. She tells them that moving it makes it become unstable to use all the time, so they will need to be careful (see mechanics of orbs). She will try to convince the party that the secret of the ring must be kept for the protection of the realm. She argues that, without it, Vel Enweir and the rest of the Elfwood will fall to the Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star. She asks the party to assassinate Malrec, destroy the evidence in the Balandel Courthouse, and get key NPCs on her side. She may even ask the party to deal with some other NPCs violently if they seem like they are taking the Archdruid's side. Before the hearing, she will give them her key to the verdant reliquary and ask them to hide it and the Twin Orb of Passage in the reliquary.

Judge Caelthas Sunstrider is a level-headed judge of the church of Elandria. He will try to maintain order and is very concerned about the case involving the Queen, who founded Vel Enweir and has ruled for four thousand years. 

Irielle Duskwhisper was a member of the Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star but promised to change. Queen Aelra Sylanthiel allowed her to live if she went to the nunnery at the church of Elandria and promised to devote herself to her. Irielle knows the codeword "pants" that the party used to decrypt Lyrian's note.

Elarin Vess is torn between his grove (he trained under the Archdruid at the Grove of Fire) and his mother, who was the Queen's highest adviser and closest friend. He will also serve as the juror for the Grove of Fire, and will be the only juror that the party will have met before.

The Archdruid's Plan

The archdruid will visit NPCs in this order to gather evidence. Every time the players visit someone, so does the archdruid. Whoever gets to people first might make a difference.

1. Garrin Dace and Serelion Vael at the Scarlet Shield Tavern
2. Elarin Vess, who may reveal the hidden questioning chamber where Talan Windfern is being held
3. Talan Windfern
4. Irielle Duskwhisper
5. Finnathan Thistle|Finn, Tilly Thistle|Tilly, and Velara Kael|Velara
6. Calenhir Sylvenblade

Day of the Hearing

> The streets outside the courthouse are choked with people—elves in traveling cloaks, merchants with half-shuttered stalls, even woodcutters from the outer villages. They press shoulder-to-shoulder, buzzing with rumor and speculation. Some cheer when you pass; others jeer, voices sharp with fear or anger. 
> 
> Inside, the great hall of judgment is already crowded. Benches line both sides of the chamber, overflowing with citizens craning to see. The vaulted ceiling rises high, its carved beams etched with scenes of druidic renewal, but the air feels close, heavy with incense and expectation.
> 
> At the front row, you spot familiar faces—Tilly, Finn, and Velara—waiting tensely, whispering among themselves as you enter.
> 
> The Queen of Balandel sits upon a low, carved seat at the front of the hall. Her posture is rigid, proud, though her fingers twitch slightly against her gown. Beside her, upon a pedestal, rests what looks at first like an ornament—a smooth silvery white sphere, glimmering faintly in the filtered light. To most, it seems a mere decoration. But to you, it is unmistakable: the other Twin Orb of Passage.
> 
> The jury benches are only half-filled, six druids robed in shades of forest and flame sitting with solemn expressions, waiting to be swayed. At the center, Judge Caelthas Sunstrider presides in his white-and-gold vestments, a silver scale emblem of Elandria hanging at his chest. His eyes flicker across the chamber, measuring not just the Queen but all who have come to watch.
> 
> A hush ripples through the hall as you step forward, the last arrivals before the trial begins.
Trial Mechanics

Structure

1. Opening Statements – Each side (Archdruid & Queen) gives a short speech. Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation checks may set the tone with the jury (minor bonuses/penalties).
2. Witness Phase – 3 rounds. Each round, both prosecution and defense may:
    - Call or cross-examine a witness (NPC or PC).
    - Present evidence (letters, artifacts, testimony).
    - The opposing side gets a rebuttal.
3. Closing Arguments – Each side makes one last push to sway the jury.

Jury Sympathies

Each juror starts with a neutral sympathy score (0), except where strong bias exists (e.g., Fire Grove leader might lean toward druids).
Sympathies range from -10 (Archdruid) to +10 (Queen).
At the end, each juror "votes" based on their score (≤ -3 = guilty, ≥ +3 = innocent, middle = undecided).

Skill Checks

Base DC 15 persuasion/deception/intimidation to sway a juror with testimony.
Juror modifiers
    - +2 if testimony aligns with their values (e.g., druids care about nature cycles).
    - -2 if testimony offends them or contradicts known facts.
Evidence: presenting a key document or artifact gives advantage or an auto-shift of 1d4 sympathy points.

Sympathy Shifts

Critical Success (nat 20): +2d4 sympathy shift.
Success: +1d4 shift.
Failure: -1d4 shift.
Critical Failure (nat 1): -2d4 shift and disadvantage on next attempt with that juror.

Secret Factors

If the party reaches a juror before the Archdruid, they get advantage on the first interaction with them.
Hidden biases (revealed with Insight DC 15–20):
    - Some jurors dislike the Queen personally.
    - Some fear the forest collapsing if the ring is destroyed.

Outcome

Majority of jury decides.
If hung jury (3 vs. 3 or indecisive) → Judge Caelthas Sunstrider casts the deciding vote, favoring justice over politics (leaning toward whichever side made the most credible case).
If the Queen wins, cultists hiding in the rafters (including Jesse Durn will attack and try to assassinate the Queen).
If the Archdruid wins, the Queen will touch the Twin Orb of Displacement and disappear. The druids will attack and the Archdruid will be enraged, declaring marshal law and try to take over the city.
