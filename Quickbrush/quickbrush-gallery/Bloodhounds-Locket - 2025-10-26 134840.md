**Original Description:**

Description

This ornate silver locket is crafted in an oval shape, its surface etched with intricate hunting scenes—wolves chasing deer, hawks diving for prey, hounds tracking through forests. The chain is delicate but surprisingly strong, made of interwoven silver links that catch the light. When opened, the locket reveals a tiny compass needle suspended on a nearly invisible thread, spinning freely in its housing.

The interior is lined with soft black velvet, and there's a small depression designed to hold a single drop of blood, a strand of hair, or a tiny personal possession. When activated, the needle glows with a faint crimson light and pulls insistently toward its target, like a hunting dog straining at its leash.

Mechanics

Bloodhound's Locket (Rare Wondrous Item, requires attunement)

Hunter's Mark: As an action, you can place a drop of a creature's blood, a strand of their hair, or a personal possession (something small they have owned or carried, such as a coin, button, or trinket) inside the locket and close it. The compass needle immediately begins pointing toward that creature, as long as they are on the same plane of existence as you.

The locket tracks the creature for up to 24 hours or until you open the locket and remove the contents. The needle always points in the direction of the creature, though it does not indicate distance or obstacles between you and your target.

Limitations:
The locket can only track one creature at a time
If the creature moves to a different plane of existence, the needle spins aimlessly
The biological sample or possession must be from the specific individual you wish to track—generic items won't work
Dead creatures cannot be tracked unless their soul still lingers on the same plane

Tracking Range: The needle remains accurate across any distance on the same plane, making it invaluable for long-distance pursuit.

Notes

%%
This is perfect for assassination contracts, hunting down escaped prisoners, or tracking someone who wronged the party. It's powerful but requires preparation—you need something from the target first.

Plot hooks:
An assassin uses this to track one of the party members
The party needs to track down a kidnapper or fleeing villain
Someone is using the locket to track them and they need to figure out who
What if someone plants a "personal possession" on a party member to track them?

The locket could have a dark history—perhaps it belonged to a famous bounty hunter or assassin. The hunting imagery isn't subtle about its purpose.

The 24-hour limit prevents it from being "I win" button while still being incredibly useful for time-sensitive missions.
