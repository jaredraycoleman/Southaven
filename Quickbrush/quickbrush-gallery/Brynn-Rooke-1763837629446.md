## Original Description

Description

Brynn Rooke is a gaunt but strikingly handsome human in his mid-thirties, with sharp cheekbones and dark, expressive eyes that seem to see through people. His entire body—arms, chest, back, even his neck—is covered in intricate magical tattoos that shift subtly in different light, each one a living canvas of arcane art. He is perpetually shirtless, displaying his work with quiet pride. His long black hair is often tied back loosely, and he moves with the languid grace of someone completely comfortable in his own skin.

Personality

Brynn is charismatic in an understated way, speaking softly and carefully, as if each word is being tattooed into the conversation. He has an artist's temperament—passionate about his craft but detached from the chaos of the world around him. He treats each tattoo as a collaboration between himself and his client, insisting on understanding their story before putting ink to skin. Despite operating in Solaris's underground, he maintains a code of ethics: he won't tattoo anyone too drunk to consent, and he refuses work that glorifies cruelty or slavery.

Background

Brynn learned the art of magical tattooing from a traveling monk of Nytheris, who taught him that ink and magic could bind together to create lasting enchantments on living flesh. He set up shop in Solaris's thriving underground scene about five years ago, quickly gaining a reputation as the best—and most expensive—tattoo artist in the capital. His clients range from criminals and rebels to bored nobles seeking something their peers would never dare display at court.

He operates out of a small, candlelit parlor tucked into the Undercroft district, where the air smells of incense and ink. Though he worships Elandria like most of Solaris, he keeps a small shrine to Nytheris in his workspace—a nod to his teacher and the shadows that shelter his art.

%%
Brynn has connections throughout the underground and hears things. He could serve as an information broker if the party earns his trust. He also knows secret routes through the city that bypass official checkpoints.

His magical tattoos use the standard D&D 5e/2024 Magical Tattoo rules from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (or similar). Common tattoos cost 100-200gp, Uncommon 400-800gp, Rare 2000-4000gp, depending on complexity and time required.
