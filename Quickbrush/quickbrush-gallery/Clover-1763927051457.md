## Original Description

Description

Clover is a large halfling settlement—more akin to a city than a village, though its residents would never call it such—nestled along the banks of the River Elryn (known to halflings as The Windy River). Its charming round-door homes are built into gentle hillsides and clustered around cobblestone squares filled with flower gardens, market stalls, and cozy taverns. Despite its size, Clover maintains a peaceful, unhurried atmosphere, where the clatter of wagon wheels and the laughter of children echo through tree-lined streets. The settlement sits about 30 miles south of Brandyburrow, connected by well-worn trade paths that wind through rolling farmland and orchards.

Background

Clover serves as a major trading hub for the halfling villages west of the Dragonspire Mountains, drawing merchants from Brandyburrow, Cobblefoot, and even distant Solaris. The river provides fresh water and a natural trade route for small barges carrying grain, wool, and crafted goods downstream.
