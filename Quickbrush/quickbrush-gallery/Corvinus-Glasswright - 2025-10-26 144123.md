**Original Description:**

The beating heart of the kingdom, Solaris is a city of sunlit grandeur built along the golden coast where the Azure River meets the sea. Its marble walls and sweeping avenues radiate outward from the Sunspire Palace, a towering citadel crowned with a spire of crystal that catches the dawn and scatters it in a thousand dazzling rays. Where Seawatch is known for beauty and indulgence, Solaris is a city of power and permanence—the capital where crown, council, and temple unite.

The streets of Solaris bustle with life at all hours. Broad boulevards shaded by citrus trees and lined with statues of kings past lead to great plazas where heralds proclaim decrees and bards sing the kingdom’s triumphs. Temples to the gods rise in harmonious rows along the Dawnward Quarter, their bells pealing across the rooftops. At its heart, Solaris is both fortress and beacon: a city that embodies the weight of Solara’s legacy and the brightness of its ambitions.

**Refined Description:**

A gaunt, pale human alchemist standing in his narrow shop, filled floor-to-ceiling with curiosity jars. He has ink-stained hands and is dressed in a long, dark, worn-out robe that has seen better days, frayed at the hems. His face is thin, with sharp features and a pair of intense, deep-set eyes that are said to look straight into the soul. His hair is long, unkempt, and as dark as midnight, cascading down to his shoulders in wild, loose strands. Each gesture he makes is precise, as if he’s always performing an intricate potion brewing. His shop is dimly lit, with the main illumination coming from the strange iridescence of the powders and tinctures in the jars around him, casting ghostly shadows across his high cheekbones and thin lips. A slight scent of mixed herbs and alchemical reagents lingers about him, adding to his mysterious aura.
