**Original Description:**

Description

Gareth Voss is a young man in his late twenties with tousled brown hair and alert blue eyes that rarely stay still for long. Though still in his prime, there’s a tired edge to his expression—a shadow of someone who’s seen more than his years should allow. His lean frame and quick, practiced movements hint at a life spent on the run or in tight spots. He wears practical work clothes—a miner’s shirt, worn gloves, and heavy boots—that let him blend easily among Southaven’s laborers, but there’s a restless sharpness to him that doesn’t quite fit the part.

Personality

Cautious and wary, Gareth tries to keep his head down and his past buried. Despite the tension in his voice when he talks about his work, he’s polite and quick to defuse conflict when he can. Those who look closely, though, might catch flashes of guilt or regret—signs of someone who wants to do the right thing but isn’t sure how anymore.

Background

Gareth grew up in Southaven, the son of a miner who worked the tunnels before him. When he was still a teenager, the Duskrunner guild pulled him into their orbit—smuggling, protection rackets, the sort of work a desperate young man takes when the mines don’t pay enough to live. He never had the stomach for their cruelty, and after a job went wrong, he slipped away, trying to rebuild his life as a simple laborer. He keeps his head down now, hoping his past doesn’t catch up with him—or the people he cares about.

**Refined Description:**

A young man in his late twenties, with tousled brown hair and alert blue eyes that move with a quickness hinting at experience beyond his years. His face has a light dusting of soot, particularly smudged on his cheeks and forehead, giving a subtle shadow around his eyes and highlighting the tired edge in his expression. His build is lean but muscular, indicating a life of physical labor. He wears a miner's shirt, the fabric a bit frayed and stained, with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. His hands are calloused, and he dons worn gloves that only partially cover his fingers. Sturdy, heavy boots are on his feet, clearly well-used and practical for traversing rough terrain. Despite his rugged appearance, there’s a sharpness in his posture that suggests alertness and readiness for action.
