## Original Description

Description

King Aldric IX Solborn is a man in his early sixties with silvered hair that was once golden. He has the traditional blue eyes of the Solborn line and carries himself with practiced regal bearing, though close observers notice the weight of his crown growing heavier each year. He dresses in white and gold, with Elandria's sunburst embroidered on his breast, and wears the Ring of Solborn—a signet passed down through every monarch since the kingdom's founding.

Unlike the warrior-kings of old, Aldric is more administrator than soldier, with soft hands and a careful, measured way of moving.

Personality

King Aldric is a pragmatic ruler who prefers negotiation to warfare and compromise to confrontation. He is intelligent and politically astute, thinking several moves ahead before making decisions. Some see this as wisdom; others see it as indecisiveness.

He maintains a close public relationship with Church of Elandria and appears devout, though some at court whisper he has grown weary and drinks more wine than he once did.

Background

Born in 1205 as the third son of King Marcus IV, Aldric never expected to inherit the throne. When plague killed his older brothers in 1235, he suddenly became heir at age thirty. Luminarch Theodric Brightspire personally mentored him for sixteen years before his coronation in 1251.

His reign has been marked by stability and prosperity, though tragedy struck in 1257 when his son and heir died in a riding accident. His wife, Queen Elendra, died in 1264, leaving his daughter Princess Mariella (who married and moved to [[Sunset Bluff]]) as his only surviving child. He has not remarried despite pressure to produce more heirs.

In recent years, tensions between the King and the Luminarch have grown, with the two often disagreeing over how to handle the increasing cult threat. The Order of the Black Star's Siege of Southaven represents the greatest crisis of his reign.

## Refined Description

An older, sickly man stands before you, his figure exuding the traces of once-powerful regality now diminished by time and weariness. His silver hair, once meticulously styled, is now disheveled, adding to the air of fatigue that surrounds him. Deep-set wrinkles carve through his face, each line perhaps telling a story of age and burden. His eyes, though piercing blue like the sky, are dulled with exhaustion, betraying a hint of weariness and introspection. His posture, slightly hunched, suggests the weight of years and the burdens of leadership. He dresses in a grand white and gold outfit, adorned with the sunburst of Elandria on his chest, though even these opulent garments do little to disguise the frailty of the man within. The simple golden circlet still graces his head, a stark reminder of his enduring royal status, but his expression, one of tired resolve, speaks of challenges faced and struggles endured.

## Prompt

An older and sickly version of the king, with wrinkles, tired eyes, and messy hair, looking directly ahead at the viewer.
