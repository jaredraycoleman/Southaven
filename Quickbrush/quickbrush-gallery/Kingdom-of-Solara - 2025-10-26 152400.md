The Kingdom of Solara is the dominant human kingdom in around the [[Aldric Sea]], founded in Year 0 of the Solaran Calendar following a prophetic vision by Saint Calros. Named for the sun and the enlightenment it represents, Solara has grown from a coastal city-state into a vast kingdom surrounding most of the Aldric Sea. The kingdom is built on the twin pillars of [[Elandria]]'s light and [[Orithon]]'s order, with The [[Church of Elandria]] serving as its spiritual foundation.

Solara is a land of culture, scholarship, and prosperity, where art and architecture flourish under royal patronage and the Church's guidance. Yet beneath its gilded surface lie tensions: noble houses vie for power, the Church's influence grows ever stronger, and dissenters flee to places like Lusteris in search of freedom from Solaran authority.

## History

### The Prophecy and Founding (Year -100 to 0)

In Year -100, The [[Church of Elandria]] consolidated various Elandrian sects into a unified religious power, establishing its hierarchy of saints and sacred orders. As the Church grew in influence, it sought a temporal power that would embody its ideals of enlightenment and civilization.

In Year 0, Saint Calros, Patron of Truth, received a divine vision from [[Elandria]] herself. The prophecy declared: "A new age of light and prosperity will dawn under the Kingdom of Solara, where truth and justice shall reign eternal."

Inspired by this vision, nobles and clergy gathered in the coastal city of [[Andora]] to establish a kingdom dedicated to Elandria's principles. They crowned King Aldric I Solborn as the first monarch, and the Solaran Calendar began. The prophecy seemed to come true almost immediately. The kingdom prospered, trade flourished, and culture bloomed under the Church's guidance.

### Early Expansion (Year 1-300)

The first three centuries of Solaran rule were marked by peaceful expansion and cultural golden age:
Art, music, and scholarship flourished under royal and Church patronage
The Church of Elandria became the state religion, with temples in every major settlement
Coastal trade routes connected Solara to distant lands
The kingdom expanded slowly along the coast

### The Windcrest Expansion (Year 300-500)

As Solara's population grew, the kingdom looked Northward to the fertile but largely unsettled northern coast of the Aldric Sea. A scouting expedition led by the sailor (and future Lord Aramond) discovered the Winscrest Valley between the [[Dragonspire Mountains]] and [[Pale Mountains]]. Around Year 400, Aramond's Lookout was established as a strategic waystation on the river, monitoring northern approaches and allowing for trade with elven city, [[Balandel]] in the [[Elfwood]], led by [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]]. Over the following centuries, settlers moved into the valley, establishing farms, villages, and trading posts.

In 515, construction of the new capital city [[Solaris]] was established along the northern coast of the Aldric Sea, around 80 miles southeast of Aramond's lookout.

### The Age of Lordships (Year 500-900)

As Solara expanded, the Crown established a system of lordships to govern distant territories:
Lords were granted authority over specific regions in the King's name
Most lords were nobles who had distinguished themselves in service to the Crown or Church
Lords collected taxes, administered justice, and maintained order
In exchange, they owed fealty, taxes, and military support to the Crown

Major lordships established during this period included [[Seawatch]], [[Sunset Bluff]], [[Lusteris]], and [[Andora]], among many others.
Various smaller holdings throughout the Windcrest Valley

### The Founding of Southaven (Year 967)

The settlement at Aramond's Lookout grew steadily, becoming a crucial trading hub between [[Fadrín]] and [[Balandel]] in the [[Elfwood]], the dwarven [[Ember Halls]] in the Pale Mountains, and [[Solaris]]. In Year 967, King Aldric VII officially chartered the nearby town as Southaven, which comes from the elvish term for hill on which it was founded "the haven south of the Elfwood."

The Kael family, who had served as stewards of the region for generations, were elevated to Lords of Southaven. This lordship quickly became one of the kingdom's most important, controlling trade routes and serving as the first line of defense against northern threats.

### The Lusteris Secession (Year 1056)

Not all Solarans embraced the Church's ever-growing influence and the Crown's expanding authority. In Year 1056, a group of dissidents (scholars, merchants, and freethinkers) left Solara for the harsh desert near The Deadlands. Against all predictions, they successfully established [[Lusteris]], a free city that rejected both Crown and Church authority.

King Marcus II declared the Lusterians traitors, but military campaigns to reclaim them failed in the brutal desert heat. Eventually, pragmatism won out: Lusteris became a valuable trading partner, and an uneasy peace was established. Many Solarans still view Lusteris with suspicion, seeing it as a haven for heretics and rebels.

### Modern Era (Year 1100-Present)

The kingdom has continued to grow and prosper, though new challenges emerge:
The The [[Witchwood]] became corrupted in Year 1097, creating a dangerous barrier south of the [[Pale Mountains]]
Trade with Lusteris has grown
Relations with the elven territories of [[Balandel]] and [[Vel Enweir]] have strengthened
Rumors of cult activity have increased in recent decades
Some nobles quietly resent the Church's ever-growing influence over royal policy

## Government and Structure

### The Monarchy

Solara is ruled by an absolute monarch who claims authority from both bloodline and divine mandate. The current ruler is [[King Aldric IX Solborn]], who ascended to the throne in Year 1251. The Solborn dynasty has ruled unbroken since the kingdom's founding, though succession has occasionally been contentious.

The King rules from Solaris, the capital city, where the royal palace stands adjacent to the Grand Cathedral of Elandria, a physical representation of the intertwined nature of Crown and Church.

### The Church's Role

The Church of Elandria is not merely the state religion. It is woven into every aspect of Solaran governance:
The Luminarch (High Priest of Elandria) serves as the King's chief spiritual advisor
Church courts handle matters of theology, marriage, and moral law
Temples serve as centers of education, healing, and charity
The Church's approval is required for noble marriages and succession
Religious festivals are national holidays

This close relationship has brought stability and prosperity, but also criticism. Some nobles believe the Church holds too much power, while commoners sometimes resent the Church's wealth and influence.

### The System of Lordships

Solara's vast territory is divided into lordships, each governed by a noble lord who rules in the King's name. The system works as follows:

Duties of a Lord:
- Administer justice within their territory
- Collect taxes and tithes (a portion goes to the Crown, a portion to the Church)
- Maintain roads, infrastructure, and public order
- Raise and command local militia in times of war
- Enforce royal decrees and Church doctrine
- Protect their lands from external threats

Rights of a Lord:
- Hereditary title (passes to eldest child, usually son, with Church approval)
- Authority to issue local ordinances (subject to royal review)
- Right to trial by their peers in the Royal Court
- Access to the King's court and participation in the Council of Lords (for major lordships)
- Ability to appoint local officials, knights, and administrators

Major Lordships:

| Lordship         | Lord                     | Notes                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [[Southaven]]    | [[Lord Elrin Kael]]      | Controls northern trade routes, guards against threats from the north    |
| [[Seawatch]]     | [[Lord Elric Kael]]      | Protects southern coastal approaches, manages maritime trade             |
| [[Sunset Bluff]] | [[Lady Brianna Ashford]] | Powerful coastal military city, protecting against pirates from the west |


Minor Lordships and Holdings:

Beneath the major lords are numerous minor nobles, landed knights, and baronets who control smaller territories. These nobles owe fealty to a major lord, who in turn owes fealty to the Crown. This feudal hierarchy ensures that even distant villages fall under Solaran authority.

The Royal Council

- The King is advised by the Royal Council, consisting of:
- The Luminarch of Elandria's Church
- The Lord Commander of the Royal Army
- The Master of Coin (oversees treasury and taxation)
- The High Justiciar (chief of royal courts)
- The Grand Architect (oversees infrastructure and construction)
- Representatives from the major lordships (when summoned)

Council meetings are held in Solaris, though major lords are rarely all present simultaneously due to the demands of governing their territories.
