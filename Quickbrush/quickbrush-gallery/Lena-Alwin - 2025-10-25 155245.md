**Original Description:**

Description

Lena Alwin is a warm-hearted woman in her late twenties with gentle features and kind eyes that still hold hope despite her current captivity. Her brown hair is usually tied back in a practical braid, and she dresses simply in the sturdy clothing of a Southaven shopkeeper. Even in captivity, she maintains a quiet dignity.

She works at her family's general store in Southaven and is known throughout the town for her generosity and kindness, often extending credit to struggling families or "accidentally" overfilling measures for those in need.

Personality

Lena is compassionate, optimistic, and sees the good in people—sometimes to a fault. She believes in second chances and redemption, which is part of what drew her to Gareth Voss despite his troubled past with The Duskrunners.

Even as a prisoner, she tries to maintain hope and treats her captors with a measured kindness that sometimes unsettles them. She's not naive—she understands the danger she's in—but she refuses to let fear turn her bitter or cruel.

Background

Lena grew up in Southaven, the daughter of shopkeepers who taught her the value of community and compassion. She met Gareth Voss a few years ago when he came into the shop looking for work after trying to leave his criminal past behind.

Despite warnings from others about his history with The Duskrunners, Lena saw something genuine in Gareth's desire to change. She gave him a chance, and they gradually fell in love. Her faith in him helped him stay on the straight path, even when temptation arose.

Recently, venturing outside Southaven's walls during the siege to search for medicinal herbs for the sick (the city's supplies were running low), Lena was captured by Marta The Knife|Marta and her bandits. The capture was personal—Marta recognized her as Gareth's new partner and, driven by jealousy and old resentments, took her prisoner despite the tactical foolishness of the move.

Now held at the southern blockade, Lena serves as an unwitting hostage. Some of Marta's bandits question why their leader risked two men for what appeared to be a random Southaven resident, not knowing about the personal history between Marta and Gareth.
