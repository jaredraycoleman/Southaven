**Original Description:**

Description

Lena Alwin is a warm-hearted woman in her late twenties with gentle features and kind eyes. Her brown hair is usually tied back in a practical braid, and she dresses simply in the sturdy clothing of a Southaven shopkeeper. She works at Rusty's Tavern in Southaven and is known throughout the town for her generosity and kindness, often extending credit to struggling families or "accidentally" over-serving those in need (which Rusty Ironbelly turns a blind eye to).

Personality

Lena is compassionate, optimistic, and sees the good in people—sometimes to a fault. She believes in second chances and redemption, which is part of what drew her to Gareth Voss, her boyfriend, despite his troubled past with The Duskrunners.

Background

Lena grew up in Southaven, the daughter of shopkeepers who taught her the value of community and compassion. She met Gareth Voss when the two were teenagers and she started working at Rusty's Tavern. Despite warnings from others about his history with The Duskrunners, Lena saw something genuine in Gareth. She gave him a chance, and they gradually fell in love. Her faith in him helped him stay on the straight path, even when temptation arose.
