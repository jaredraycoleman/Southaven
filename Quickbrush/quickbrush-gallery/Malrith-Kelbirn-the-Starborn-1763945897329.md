## Original Description

Description

Clad in blackened armor and draped in a cloak that seems to drink in the light, Malrith Kelbirn is a figure who inspires awe and dread in equal measure. His long, dark hair whips about like a storm, and his eyes glow faintly red, as if lit from within by a star's dying ember. In one hand he carries a staff crowned with a curling black flame, a symbol of the Order of the Black Star's devotion to Taelkor|The Unmaker.

He is called the Starborn, whether as prophecy, title, or self-proclaimed truth, none can say. Wherever he appears, his presence bends conversations, allegiances, and even battlefields around him, like a planet caught in the pull of a greater sun.

Personality

Malrith is not a raving cultist but a visionary tyrant—composed, articulate, and unfalteringly certain of his destiny. His words are soft-spoken yet heavy, like oracles chiseled in stone. He treats allies as disciples, enemies as obstacles, and the world itself as a stage for Taelkor's return.

Though he can be patient and calculating, Malrith is utterly merciless when his vision is threatened. He despises Pantheon of gods who betrayed Taelkor, and he teaches that their Awakening was not a triumph but a weakness—one he intends to erase.

Background

Malrith's life began in the neon-lit desert city of Lusteris. Orphaned at birth, he wandered the streets of gamblers, thieves, and hustlers until he was found by a forgotten mystic—one of the last living Taelkor worshippers. This mentor taught him the secret histories of the Builders, the betrayal of the gods, and the Unmaker's vision of perfect erasure.

Where others had failed to keep the Black Star alive, Malrith succeeded. He combined forbidden knowledge, the underworld cunning of Lusteris, and his own natural charisma to rebuild the Order of the Black Star from ashes. He restructured it into a true movement—no longer scattered zealots but a vast, disciplined cult spanning cities and kingdoms.

It was Malrith who declared the old prophecies fulfilled: that he was the Starborn, destined to prepare the way for Taelkor's return.

## Refined Description

The character is a striking figure, encased in blackened armor that appears as though it has absorbed every hint of light around it, casting an aura of darkness. Draped over his shoulders is a cloak that seems to drink in the surrounding light, enhancing the enigmatic aura he exudes. His hair is long and dark, flowing wildly like a raging storm around his head. His eyes are particularly striking, glowing faintly red, reminiscent of embers of a dying star, casting an intense gaze. In his hand, he wields a staff topped with a curling black flame, adding to his intimidating presence. His overall appearance is both awe-inspiring and intimidating, as he seems to command attention and fear with his mere presence.
