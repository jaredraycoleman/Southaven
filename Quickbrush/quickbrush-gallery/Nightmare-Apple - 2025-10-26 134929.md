**Original Description:**

These apples grow on trees tainted by corruption. They appear glossy and red with faint violet veining beneath the skin, and they smell oddly sweet, almost intoxicating.

Effects (When Eaten)

Immediate Taste: The apple tastes delicious, unnaturally so, and the eater feels briefly invigorated. They regain 1d6 + 2 hit points.
Nightmare Curse: Within 1d4 hours, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disturbing visions when next they sleep.
    - On a failure, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion upon waking.
    - On a success, the dreams still come, but the creature awakens shaken and has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws until their next long rest.
Lingering Taint: If three or more Nightmare Apples are consumed within a week, the eater becomes marked by the Bloom — glowing violet veins faintly appear under the skin. While marked, they automatically fail the save against the Nightmare Curse until the corruption is cleansed (e.g., by _Greater Restoration_, _Remove Curse_, or sunlight purification).

**Refined Description:**

This apple is distinctly menacing in appearance, its surface shining with a deep, glossy red that draws the eye. Intricate veins of faint violet meander across its skin, reminiscent of a delicate web that suggests something otherworldly beneath. The overall shape is that of a typical apple, round and invitingly plump. However, a subtle, heady aroma, sweeter than usual and almost bewitching, emanates from it, hinting at its unnatural nature. The apple's seductive appearance is both enchanting and slightly unsettling, as if it promises both delight and danger in equal measure.
