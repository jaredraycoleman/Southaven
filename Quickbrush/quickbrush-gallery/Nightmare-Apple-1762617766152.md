# Nightmare Apple

![[Nightmare-Apple-1762617766131.png]]

## Generation Details

**Type:** item
**Quality:** high
**Aspect Ratio:** square

## Original Description

These apples grow on trees tainted by corruption. They appear glossy and red with faint violet veining beneath the skin, and they smell oddly sweet, almost intoxicating.

Effects (When Eaten)

Immediate Taste: The apple tastes delicious, unnaturally so, and the eater feels briefly invigorated. They regain 1d6 + 2 hit points.
Nightmare Curse: Within 1d4 hours, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disturbing visions when next they sleep.
    - On a failure, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion upon waking.
    - On a success, the dreams still come, but the creature awakens shaken and has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws until their next long rest.
Lingering Taint: If three or more Nightmare Apples are consumed within a week, the eater becomes marked by the Bloom — glowing violet veins faintly appear under the skin. While marked, they automatically fail the save against the Nightmare Curse until the corruption is cleansed (e.g., by _Greater Restoration_, _Remove Curse_, or sunlight purification).

## Refined Description

The item is a glossy red apple with a smooth surface. Faint, violet veins run beneath its skin, creating an intricate, web-like pattern that shimmers subtly in the light. The apple has an unusual, almost intoxicatingly sweet aroma that is noticeable from a short distance. Its overall shape is plump and inviting, typical of a healthy, ripe apple, but the unusual coloring suggests something otherworldly about its nature.
