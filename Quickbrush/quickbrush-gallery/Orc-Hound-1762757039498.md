## Original Description

Orc-hounds are stout, barrel-chested canines bred by goblinoid tribes for companionship rather than hunting prowess. With their squat bodies, pushed-in snouts, and perpetually confused expressions, these dogs are thoroughly unthreatening despite their fearsome name. Their breathing is loud and wheezy, often accompanied by enthusiastic snorting when excited. Wide-set eyes give them a permanently startled look, and their underbite displays small tusks that wouldn't intimidate a field mouse.

Despite their dopey demeanor, orc-hounds are fiercely loyal to their masters and surprisingly stubborn. They possess an uncanny ability to sleep through battles, snore through stealth missions, and demand belly rubs at the most inconvenient moments. Warriors who keep them insist the dogs are fearless guards; in truth, orc-hounds are simply too dim to recognize danger.

Their short legs and stocky build make them comically ill-suited for any practical military purpose, yet they've become status symbols among hobgoblin officers. Nothing says "I've achieved success" quite like a wheezing, snorting companion that requires carrying up stairs and tips over when it gets too excited.

Most orc-hounds answer to aggressive-sounding names like "Ripper" or "Fang," which their harmless nature renders absolutely adorable.

## Refined Description

The creature is a stout, barrel-chested canine with a muscular, compact build. It has a short, smooth fawn-colored coat that highlights its robust physique. The head is broad and flat at the top, adorned with pronounced wrinkles that give it a distinctive look. This creature features wide-set, large, and dark eyes that provide a permanently startled expression. Its snout is pushed-in, accompanied by a noticeable underbite showcasing small, non-intimidating tusks. The ears are tall and bat-like, standing erect atop its head, adding to its curious appearance. Despite its fairly small stature, the creature's chest is broad, transitioning into short, sturdy legs with compact paws. This canine exudes a mixture of loyalty and perplexity, often seen in a sitting position with a relaxed demeanor, eyes looking straight ahead as if perpetually seeking attention or approval.
