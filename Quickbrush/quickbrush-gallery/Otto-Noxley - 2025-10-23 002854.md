Description: Personality & BackgroundOtto Noxley grew up in Pitlochry, nestled among dense forests and fairy rings, where magic hums quietly beneath moss and root. With emotionally distant parents who often argued, Otto found peace in nature—and in the company of magical beings who showed him a different kind of strength.Small, soft-spoken, and often mocked for being “too gentle,” Otto learned to read emotions like spells—fluid, shifting, and powerful. He never believed he’d get into Hogwarts, assuming he was too weak. But in truth, magic had become a part of him because he listened to it, lived alongside it, and let it in.Now, Otto is determined to prove that strength comes not from power or status, but from empathy, precision, and quiet resilience.StrengthsDeep intuitive understanding of Charms and subtle natural magic.Emotionally intelligent and highly observant.Deep connection to magical creatures and nonhuman entities.WandCedar, Phoenix Feather Core, 11.5", Slightly YieldingFactsNationality: ScottishParents: Arthur & Bridget Noxley—wealthy wizards who profit from the sale of house-elves (a fact Otto quietly resents)Most Excited About: Studying Herbology (1st year) and Care of Magical Creatures (3rd year and beyond)Most Treasured Possession: A necklace gifted by a fairy, said to have protective magic—though he’s never tested itBiggest Fear: Failing at school, being lonely, and DementorsPhotos![[otto_11.png|173x260]]![[otto_13.png|173x260]]![[otto_15.png|173x260]]![[otto_17.png|173x260]]![[otto_20.png|173x260]]![[otto20happy.png|173x260]]Otto NoxleyOtto Noxley
