**Original Description:**

Description

Rothgar "Red-Hand" is a weathered bandit captain whose face tells the story of countless battles. A jagged scar runs from his left temple to his jaw, and his right hand—the one that earned him his nickname—is permanently stained crimson from an old curse or ritual gone wrong. He wears mismatched armor scavenged from fallen enemies, and a black star amulet hangs prominently around his neck.

His eyes carry the fervor of a true believer, and he speaks of the cult's promises with unsettling conviction. Despite his brutal reputation, he's a veteran commander who knows how to organize and lead men effectively.

Personality

Rothgar is a pragmatic zealot—a dangerous combination. He believes wholeheartedly in the Order of the Black Star's promises of power and wealth, but he's also experienced enough to know how to survive. He's brutal when necessary but not needlessly cruel, preferring efficiency over spectacle.

He commands through a mixture of respect earned from his veteran status and fear inspired by his cult connections. His men know he's connected to something dark and powerful, which keeps them in line even when morale is low.

Background

Rothgar served for years under Donavar Reddmark before Donavar's death at the hands of Velara Kael. When Blacksoul Silas approached him with promises of power and gold in exchange for controlling the northern approaches to Southaven, Rothgar saw an opportunity to rise from enforcer to commander.

He established the northern blockade with ruthless efficiency, turning it into a fortified checkpoint that has successfully cut off Southaven's northern supply lines. Unlike some of the more opportunistic bandits at the southern blockade, Rothgar is a true believer who has undergone cult rituals and received the black star brand.

His "red hand" is the result of a blood ritual he performed to prove his loyalty to the Black Star. The stain never fades, serving as both a mark of his devotion and a warning to those who would oppose him.

Connections

**Refined Description:**

Rothgar is a tall, imposing figure with a rugged, weathered appearance. His skin is tanned and rough, showing the signs of a life spent outdoors and in conflict. The most noticeable feature is the deep, jagged scar that runs from his left temple down to his jaw, a testament to his many battles. His eyes are a piercing gray, filled with intensity and a hint of something unsettling.

Rothgar's hair is a tangled mane of dark brown, streaked with gray, and he wears it long, brushing against his broad shoulders. His face is adorned with a thick beard, which is as unkempt as his hair. The right hand, famously known as "Red-Hand," is permanently stained a deep crimson, giving it a sinister, cursed appearance.

He dons mismatched armor, a hodgepodge of pieces taken from various adversaries he has defeated over the years. The armor is dented and scratched but still serviceable, covering most of his sturdy frame. Around his neck hangs a black star amulet, an ominous symbol that hints at dark affiliations.

Rothgar's presence is further emphasized by his towering stance and the confident, commanding way he carries himself.
