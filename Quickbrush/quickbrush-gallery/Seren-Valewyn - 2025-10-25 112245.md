**Original Description:**

Description

Seren Valewyn looks like a daydream that wandered into the wrong story. Her bright blue hair, often tied in an uneven braid, seems perpetually caught in some invisible breeze, and her square glasses slide down her nose no matter how many times she pushes them back up. Her armor—polished by effort rather than success—never quite fits right, and she carries her training blade with more enthusiasm than grace.

Her laughter is quick and contagious, and her voice carries an almost musical lilt when she speaks, as though she is always half-reciting a song no one else knows. Despite her clumsiness, there's a spark of earnest courage in her eyes—a sincerity that even the Queen's veterans can't help but find disarming.

Personality

Seren is curious to a fault and perpetually distracted by anything shimmering, mysterious, or remotely magical. She has a boundless imagination and an unshakable optimism that borders on delusion. Where Landor Vess embodies precision and severity, Seren embodies possibility—every moment, in her mind, could be the start of something extraordinary.

She idolizes her commander, though she understands very little of him. To her, Landor's stoic silence is not intimidation but mystique; his disapproval, a challenge she is determined to conquer. Her attempts at humor around him are often met with long, wordless stares—stares she cheerfully interprets as progress.

Though often underestimated, Seren is not without talent. Beneath her scatterbrained demeanor lies a startling intuition in battle—an instinct that seems to guide her in the nick of time. Some whisper she has a touch of fey blood, or perhaps an untrained gift she herself has yet to notice.

Background

Seren was born in a small glade near the eastern edge of Vel Enweir, the daughter of a woodcarver and a herbalist. She grew up surrounded by the hum of cicadas and the scent of cedar, far from courts or battlefields. Her dreams of adventure began with stories told by passing soldiers, tales of valor and tragedy that filled her with equal parts wonder and disbelief.

When recruiters from the Queen's army passed through her village, Seren volunteered before they even asked. Her aptitude for swordplay was… debatable, but her enthusiasm proved impossible to ignore. By some twist of fate—or perhaps by a dare among the officers—she was assigned as squire to General Landor Vess himself.

No one knows quite why Landor kept her. Perhaps he saw potential where others saw chaos. Perhaps he simply lacked the energy to protest. Whatever the reason, she has followed him ever since—through rain, war, and endless silence—chatting cheerfully while he broods.

Among the soldiers, she's become something of a legend: the only person alive who's ever made Landor sigh out loud.

**Refined Description:**

A young woman stands ready, adorned in intricate battle-mage attire. Her bright blue hair cascades in waves down her back, left unbound to flow freely. She wears a dark blue robe embroidered with silver runes that shimmer under the light, catching the eye with their mystical glow. Her outfit consists of a fitted tunic and loose trousers that allow ease of movement, cinched by a broad belt holding various small pouches and magical charms. Around her shoulders, a deep hooded cloak is draped, the cloak's deep purple fabric lined with faint, silvery threads.

Her square glasses sit slightly tilted on her nose, catching the light with a flash of reflection as she moves. In her hand, she wields a slender staff of polished wood, capped with a crystal orb that hums with faint energy. Her hands, surprisingly delicate, carry the staff with a practiced ease, suggesting both familiarity and latent power. Her eyes, a striking shade of violet, are alive with excitement and determination, their gaze sharp yet kind. The ensemble lends her a presence that is both ethereal and formidable, as though she walks the line between reality and the arcane.

**Context Prompt:**
