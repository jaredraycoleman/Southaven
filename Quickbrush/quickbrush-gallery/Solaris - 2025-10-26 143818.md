**Original Description:**

The beating heart of the kingdom, Solaris is a city of sunlit grandeur built along the golden coast where the Azure River meets the sea. Its marble walls and sweeping avenues radiate outward from the Sunspire Palace, a towering citadel crowned with a spire of crystal that catches the dawn and scatters it in a thousand dazzling rays. Where Seawatch is known for beauty and indulgence, Solaris is a city of power and permanence—the capital where crown, council, and temple unite.

The streets of Solaris bustle with life at all hours. Broad boulevards shaded by citrus trees and lined with statues of kings past lead to great plazas where heralds proclaim decrees and bards sing the kingdom’s triumphs. Temples to the gods rise in harmonious rows along the Dawnward Quarter, their bells pealing across the rooftops. At its heart, Solaris is both fortress and beacon: a city that embodies the weight of Solara’s legacy and the brightness of its ambitions.

**Refined Description:**

A stout man in his mid-40s, standing around 5'8" with a solid, muscular build that speaks to a lifetime of hard labor at the forge. His square face is marked by a prominent scar running diagonally from just below his left eye down to the edge of his chiseled jawline, testament to a past filled with danger or perhaps a blacksmithing accident. His skin is weathered and tanned, contrasting sharply with the neatly cropped short hair of steely gray-black sitting atop his head. His eyes, a steely blue, possess a penetrating gaze that often matches the sharpness of his crafted blades. A thick mustache frames his upper lip, merging with a hint of stubble on the rest of his face, giving him a rugged yet well-kept appearance. He is dressed in a heavy leather apron, typical for a blacksmith, over a simple tunic. His large hands, calloused and stained with the indelible marks of soot and steel, are rarely seen resting without his signature ceremonial hammer, which he carries with pride. Despite his formidable appearance, his posture is open and honest, making clear his no-nonsense attitude and commanding presence in the bustling marketplace of Solaris.
