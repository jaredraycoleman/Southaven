**Original Description:**

The beating heart of the kingdom, Solaris is a city of sunlit grandeur built along the golden coast where the Azure River meets the sea. Its marble walls and sweeping avenues radiate outward from the Sunspire Palace, a towering citadel crowned with a spire of crystal that catches the dawn and scatters it in a thousand dazzling rays. Where Seawatch is known for beauty and indulgence, Solaris is a city of power and permanence—the capital where crown, council, and temple unite.

The streets of Solaris bustle with life at all hours. Broad boulevards shaded by citrus trees and lined with statues of kings past lead to great plazas where heralds proclaim decrees and bards sing the kingdom’s triumphs. Temples to the gods rise in harmonious rows along the Dawnward Quarter, their bells pealing across the rooftops. At its heart, Solaris is both fortress and beacon: a city that embodies the weight of Solara’s legacy and the brightness of its ambitions.

**Refined Description:**

A graceful high elf with an air of timeless elegance, standing at a height that commands gentle reverence. Her face is characterized by delicate, symmetrical features; almond-shaped, radiant golden eyes exude an aura of wisdom and insight. Her skin is smooth and fair, with a faint ethereal glow under sunlight. Long, silvery hair cascades in soft waves down her back, shimmering with an almost metallic sheen as it catches the light. Today, she is adorned in a flowing robe of deep azure, embroidered with intricate patterns of silver and faintly glowing runes tracing the hem and cuffs. Her jewelry is minimal yet striking, including a pair of delicately crafted earrings of shining crystal that seem to catch and reflect the colors of the room. Meliora's soft smile suggests a knowing confidence, and her posture is straight yet relaxed, exuding an air of approachable mystique.
