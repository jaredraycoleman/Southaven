## Original Description

Description

Sunset Bluff is a small human settlement perched on the windswept cliffs overlooking the western sea, about 80 miles west of Seawatch and 50 miles southwest of Cobblefoot. The village consists of sturdy timber and stone buildings clustered around a natural harbor, where fishing boats bob in the tide and gulls cry overhead. True to its name, the settlement is famous for its breathtaking sunsets, when the sky blazes orange and pink over the endless horizon, casting the white cliffs in golden light. The air tastes of salt and sea spray, and the constant sound of waves crashing against the rocks below creates a rhythmic backdrop to daily life.

Background

Sunset Bluff survives primarily on fishing and small-scale trade with passing ships. Its remote location keeps it isolated from the major conflicts and politics of Windcrest Valley, though travelers and merchants occasionally stop here to resupply before continuing north to Seawatch or south along the coast.

## Refined Description

Sunset Bluff is depicted as a quaint village situated on towering cliffs that rise dramatically over the western sea. The scene is set during the evening, just as the sun begins to dip below the horizon, igniting the sky with brilliant hues of orange and pink. The natural harbor is alive with activity as small fishing boats drift gently in the rolling tide, their nets glistening with the day's catch. Seagulls circle above, their cries mingling with the constant rhythm of waves crashing against the white, weathered cliffs below. Sturdy timber and stone structures form a tight-knit community around the harbor, exuding a sense of resilience against the elements. The air is thick with the scent of salt and sea, while a gentle breeze carries the refreshing mist of ocean spray. Golden light washes over the scene, painting the settlement and cliffs in warm, inviting tones, encapsulating the village's namesake and its idyllic coastal charm.
