## Original Description

Tucked between a perfumery and a bookshop that refuses to alphabetize, The Velvet Crust is a narrow little patisserie with deep red awnings and frosted-glass windows etched in swirling, floury runes. The smell—warm butter, plum jam, and just a hint of thyme—wraps around you like a velvet cloak the moment you step inside.

Behind the glass counter: rows of perfect, gleaming pastries arranged with near-military precision. Nothing is labeled. You are expected to _know_.

The proprietor, Céline Aravel, is a middle-aged elf with silver-streaked hair pulled into a bun so tight it could slice fruit. She does not greet you. She gestures. If you ask too many questions, she sighs audibly. But mention Bixby Wizzlethorpe, and her brows lift exactly one millimeter.



She still won't smile. But your pear-saffron galette will be discounted (10%), and it will be the best damn thing you've tasted in three cities.

## Refined Description

The Velvet Crust is nestled in a quaint street between a vibrant perfumery and a chaotic bookshop, marked by its striking deep red awnings. The front windows are frosted and intricately etched with swirling designs that evoke the appearance of floury runes. Inside, the air is infused with a mouth-watering aroma of warm butter and sweet plum jam, with a subtle hint of thyme. The patisserie is intimate and narrow, with a glass counter displaying an immaculate array of pastries, each gleaming under soft lighting, arranged with meticulous care. The atmosphere is sophisticated yet unassuming, inviting a sense of familiarity, but with an expectation that the patrons are discerning and knowledgeable about their choices.
