**Original Description:**

Description

Vanessa Tywin is a young noblewoman in her early twenties with her mother's elegant features but a softer, more anxious demeanor. She dresses in fine clothing appropriate to her station, though the siege has forced compromises in her usual standards. Her hands often fidget with her jewelry when nervous—a tell she's never quite managed to control.

She has the look of someone who has lived a sheltered, privileged life and is now facing harsh realities she was never prepared for.

Personality

Vanessa is not as pragmatically ruthless as her mother Elen Tywin. She's more idealistic and naive, wanting to believe in honor and doing the right thing, but she's been raised in a world where privilege and survival often require moral flexibility.

She's frightened by the siege and the dangers surrounding Southaven, and she defers to her mother's judgment on matters of survival. She feels guilty about attempting to flee while others suffer, but her fear and her mother's insistence overrode those concerns.

Vanessa is kind-hearted but lacks the strength of will to stand against her mother's decisions. She wants to do good but doesn't know how to balance that desire with her family's self-preservation instincts.

Background

Vanessa grew up in comfort as the daughter of a wealthy Southaven noble family. She was educated in music, literature, and the social graces expected of her station. She had dreams of perhaps traveling to Lusteris or Fadrín to study art or become a patron of culture.

When the siege began, Vanessa was terrified. The violence, the shortages, the desperation—none of it fit into her sheltered understanding of the world. When her mother Elen Tywin proposed hiring Edwin the Smuggler|Edwin to escape, Vanessa felt torn between guilt at abandoning Southaven and relief at the prospect of safety.

She agreed to the escape attempt, justifying it to herself that they couldn't help anyone if they starved or died in the siege. When they were captured by cultists in Blacktide Swamp, Vanessa's worst fears were realized—and she's now facing horrors she never imagined in her privileged upbringing.

Current Situation

Vanessa is imprisoned in Blacktide Swamp alongside her mother. She's terrified of the cultists and the undead that roam the area. She clings to hope that someone will rescue them, but that hope grows dimmer each day.

Motivations

Surviving her captivity
Staying close to her mother for comfort and protection
Holding onto hope that rescue will come
Secretly wishing she'd been braver and stayed to help Southaven

**Refined Description:**

A young woman, around her early twenties, possessing a delicate, noble appearance reflective of her highborn status. Her facial features are refined, with a striking resemblance to her mother, though softened by a noticeable anxiety that contrasts with her elegant lineage. She wears a well-crafted gown suitable for nobility, though it's been visibly worn down by the harsh realities of her current situation.

Her hair is styled in a simple yet refined manner, perhaps tied back or in a modest updo that befits her noble status, highlighting her gentle face. Her skin is fair and delicate, indicative of a life once sheltered from the elements and laborious work.

Vanessa's hands, though elegant, are afflicted by slight trembling, often seen fussing with a piece of jewelry or wringing together, revealing her inner nervousness. Her eyes, wide and apprehensive, reflect an individual who has been thrust into circumstances far beyond her sheltered upbringing, showcasing a mix of fear and an underlying flicker of hope.

Despite her disheveled attire due to the ongoing ordeal, she maintains an aura of poise and grace, with posture slightly hunched perhaps from the weight of current fears. Her overall presence speaks of a woman out of her element, struggling to maintain dignity amidst adversity.
