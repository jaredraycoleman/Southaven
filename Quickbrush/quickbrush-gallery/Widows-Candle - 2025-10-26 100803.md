**Original Description:**

Description

This unsettling black candle stands about six inches tall, its wax darker than midnight and smooth as polished obsidian. When lit, it burns with a dim purple flame that casts eerie, dancing shadows but produces no smoke whatsoever. The flame seems to draw light toward it rather than emit it, creating an almost hypnotic effect.

The candle's wick appears to be made from braided strands of silver hair, and as it burns, a faint sweet scent—like funeral flowers—fills the air. Those nearby report feeling an unusual drowsiness, as if the candle itself whispers lullabies too quiet to consciously hear.

Mechanics

Widow's Candle (Uncommon Wondrous Item, consumable)

You possess 3 candles with this property.

Unbreakable Slumber: As an action, you can light the candle. While the candle burns, any sleeping humanoid within 60 feet of it enters a deep, magical slumber. These creatures automatically fail saving throws against effects that would wake them, and external noises, movement, or even minor physical contact (such as being jostled or lightly shaken) does not rouse them.

If a sleeping creature takes damage or is subjected to violent motion (such as being dragged or thrown), they immediately wake up as normal.

The candle burns for 10 minutes before consuming itself entirely. The flame cannot be extinguished by normal means (wind, water, etc.) but can be snuffed out by magical darkness or by the wielder using an action to do so.

Limitation: The candle only affects creatures who are already asleep when it is lit. It does not cause wakefulness or put creatures to sleep—it merely ensures they remain asleep.

Notes

%%
Perfect for assassination missions, infiltration, or covering up crimes. The 10-minute duration is enough to get in, do the deed, and get out, but not so long that it's overpowered.

Story considerations:
Where do these candles come from? A coven of night hags? A death cult?
What if someone lights one near the party while they're sleeping?
Could be used in a heist scenario to keep guards asleep
Moral implications: using it to murder someone in their sleep is dark

The name "Widow's Candle" implies these were originally created to help grieving widows... sleep through their grief? Or perhaps something more sinister—ensuring their husbands never wake up?

**Refined Description:**

This candle is crafted from black wax and stands approximately six inches tall. Its surface is smooth, akin to polished obsidian, and the wax is so dark that it appears to absorb surrounding light. When lit, the candle produces a dim, eerie purple flame that flickers and casts strange, dancing shadows around it. The unique flame doesn't emit smoke, contributing to its unsettling presence. The wick is surprisingly made from braided strands of silver hair, giving it an unusual texture and appearance. As the candle burns, it releases a faint aroma akin to funeral flowers, permeating the air with a sweet yet melancholy scent. Nearby, an inexplicable sense of drowsiness envelops those in its presence, as if the candle murmurs soothing lullabies just beyond the range of hearing. Even in the darkest setting, the flame distinctively draws light inwards rather than emitting it, creating a captivating and otherworldly atmosphere.
