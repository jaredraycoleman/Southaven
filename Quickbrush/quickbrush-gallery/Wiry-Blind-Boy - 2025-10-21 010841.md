**Original Description:**

Description

Daran Grimsby is a wiry young man of eighteen with sandy-brown hair, sharp hazel eyes, and an eager, restless energy. His lean frame and calloused hands speak of long days spent outdoors — running errands, helping traders, or wandering the edges of the forest. He carries himself with quiet confidence, often flashing a quick grin that mirrors his father’s warmth but with a touch more daring.

He dresses in practical leathers and travel gear rather than the shopkeeper’s clothes he grew up around, his cloak often dusted from the road or smudged with ink from his journal of sketches and notes. There’s always a sense that he’s ready to move — to prove himself beyond the walls of Southaven.
Personality

Daran is bright, loyal, and stubborn in equal measure. He inherited his father’s easy charm but tempers it with youthful impulsiveness and a desire to carve out his own path. Though he respects William deeply, he sometimes chafes under his father’s cautious nature, yearning for adventure and a life of meaning.

He’s quick to laugh, slow to anger, and fiercely protective of his friends and family. His curiosity can border on recklessness, but his heart is always in the right place.

> “Pa says a good merchant knows when to stay put. Maybe so. But a good scout knows when the road’s calling.”

Background

The only child of William Grimsby, the beloved shopkeeper of Southaven, Daran grew up surrounded by travelers, adventurers, and stories of far-off places. From a young age, he helped in the shop — fetching supplies, cataloging goods, and chatting with customers — but his attention always drifted to the tales of the open road.

When he came of age, Daran began working with Southaven’s scouts and couriers, learning survival skills, tracking, and a bit of swordplay. Though still inexperienced, he’s earned a reputation as quick-thinking and brave, if occasionally reckless.

Some say he’ll inherit his father’s business someday; others think he’ll vanish into the wilds chasing the next horizon. Whatever path he takes, those who know him agree — Daran Grimsby is his father’s son through and through: kind-hearted, clever, and unshakably loyal to the people of Southaven.
