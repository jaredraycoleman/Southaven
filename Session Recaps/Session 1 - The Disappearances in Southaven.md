summary: The party was hired by Lord Kael to investigate the mysterious disappearances
  in Southaven. Their search led them to a bandit ambush, which they overcame before
  discovering a cultist hideout inside a cave. There, they disrupted a dark ritual
  involving a black crystal, which the cultist leader destroyed before his defeat.
  Clues found in the hideout, including a map, pointed them toward Southaven Mines
  and Blacktide Swamp as potential locations of interest. After returning to town,
  they sought the expertise of Dr. Bixby Wizzlethorpe, an eccentric alchemist, who
  identified a Ring of Mind Shielding from the cultist leader and requested their
  help in collecting rare alchemical ingredients. Their findings suggested that something
  far more sinister was at play.

[[Southaven]] had a problem. People were vanishing, and [[Lord Elrin Kael]] wanted answers. So, he turned to a group of hired adventurers: [[Lirielle]], an elf wizard from the mountain town of Fadrin; [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]], a blessed elf originally from the capital of [[Balandel]], but who grew up in the outskirts of Fadrin; and [[Dravencoles]], a rugged human paladin living in a Cabin near the Seven Lakes in the Eastern Dragonspire Mountains.

Before setting out, they stopped by the town's General Store, where they met its charismatic owner, [[William Grimsby]]. Though they considered stocking up on healing potions, the 50-gold price tag sent them looking for more affordable alternatives. Instead, they settled for a medical kit.

Their first real taste of trouble came on the North Road when bandits ambushed them. The battle was swift and brutal, with the adventurers emerging victorious. One of the attackers, though bloodied and defiant, refused to speak. Unwilling to let the trail go cold, the adventurers resorted to harsher measures, forcing the cultist to reveal the path to their hideout before his silence became permanent.

Following his directions, they tracked their way to a cave, where a grim revelation awaited them. Inside, they found a cult of fanatics performing dark rituals around a foreboding black crystal.

The ensuing fight was fierce. Blades clashed, spells crackled, and the scent of blood and smoke filled the chamber. The adventurers proved relentless, cutting through the cultists until only their leader remained. Sensing his doom, he made a desperate move - he shattered the crystal before meeting his end.

Amidst the carnage, they made an unexpected ally. A [[Leonard Chesterwolfe|wolf]], held captive by the cult, found its freedom thanks to Ferinthria's magic. At first, the beast hesitated, then vanished into the wilds. But when the adventurers needed it most, it returned, a loyal companion to Ferinthria from that moment on.

As they searched the hideout, they uncovered crucial clues: maps marked with two ominous locations - Southaven Mines and [[Blacktide Swamp]]. There was more at play here than just kidnappings. Something darker, something ancient.

After returning to town, they sought out [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe]], the eccentric town alchemist, to identify a peculiar Ring of Mind Shielding taken from the cultist leader. He obliged, and asked for their help collecting rare alchemical ingredients to help him concoct some of his... [[Bixby's Cocktails|special cocktails]].

With more questions than answers, the adventurers knew their journey had only just begun.
