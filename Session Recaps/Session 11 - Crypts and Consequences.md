summary: Emerging from the Vault, the party encountered a suspicious guard investigating
  Winnifred's corpse. Though initially detained, they escaped after Momeline used
  magic and Dravencoles incapacitated the remaining guards. Lirielle cleverly redirected
  approaching patrols, but they spotted her image on a wanted poster. At the Thistle
  home, the group debriefed Velara and decided to pursue the mystery of the missing
  priestesses. Using a divine medallion gifted by Ithilwen, Dravencoles located a
  hidden crypt filled with necromantic activity. Inside, they fought cultists, undead,
  and ultimately a powerful Mezzoloth sustaining itself through bound priests. Ferinthria's
  fire magic and the group's quick tactics broke the ritual, freeing the captives.
  Among the cult's notes, they found ominous references to a weapon called "the hammer,"
  which had passed a dark test and been relocated to Lusteris' most secure location.

The party emerged from the Vault of Imperative Truth, only to find a guard investigating the chamber where [[Winnifred Redwyne]] lay dead. The guard, visibly suspicious, ordered the party to wait in the adjoining room. There, another guard recognized [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] and [[Lirielle]] from wanted posters. A tense standoff ensued—Momeline gave her real name, while [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] offered a false one. Acting swiftly, Momeline cast Sleep on one guard, while [[Dravencoles]] knocked out the other before they could raise an alarm.

On their way out of the [[Marble Academy]] Library, the party was nearly intercepted again. A group of guards approached, but Lirielle, thinking quickly, pointed them back toward the restricted wing. The guards took the bait and ran. As the group slipped away, they spotted Lirielle's image on a wanted poster, confirming their faces were known in [[Lusteris]].

Back at the Thistle household, the group recounted the encounter to [[Velara Kael|Velara]] and the Thistles. They discussed the book Void Crowned, Star Bound and the implications of the Vault. More pressing, though, was the matter brought to them by [[Ithilwen Galandel]]—the disappearing priestesses of the [[Sapphire Temple]].

Following Ithilwen's lead, the party investigated the crypts behind the city's ossuary. Using the medallion Ithilwen had gifted him, Dravencoles detected necromantic activity and identified a suspicious tomb. Inside, they uncovered a hidden passage leading to a dark cult lair.

In the first chamber, the party ambushed a cultist in meditation. Momeline struck first with a devastating sneak attack, but the cultist survived long enough to summon three undead. Lirielle and Ferinthria handled them efficiently, but the noise alerted others. Reinforcements came—six cultists and two dark priests—but Ferinthria unleashed a devastating fireball, reducing the bulk of them to ash. Lirielle and Momeline dispatched the survivors.

In the southern crypt, they discovered a skeletal corpse, a cache of loot, and a chilling note:

> “The hammer has been verified. It drank from the source and did not break. The priestesses screamed, and the light leapt to their aid.”

The note also confirmed the cult was experimenting on the priestesses.

As they continued their search, the party encountered shadowy undead in the north and south chambers. Dravencoles channeled radiant energy through divine smite, burning them away with holy light. In the northern crypt, they discovered the missing priestesses, weak but alive. Dravencoles used his Lay on Hands to heal them, and the party guided them to safety.

The final room housed a terrible foe: a Mezzoloth, locked in a ritual with three priests bound to glowing columns that simultaneously healed the creature and drained the captives. The battle was brutal. Lirielle and Momeline realized the columns were the source of the Mezzoloth's power, and with Ferinthria and Dravencoles working together, they shattered them. The priests were freed, and the Mezzoloth fell—but not before forcing the party to spend nearly every resource to survive.

With the cultists defeated and the priestesses rescued, the party now has more answers—but even more troubling questions. Is this hammer that "passed the test" The Holy Warhammer of [[Elandria]]—and why was it moved to Lusteris' "most secure location"? What ritual were the dark priests attempting, and who gave the order to use the priestesses as vessels for such cruel experiments?
