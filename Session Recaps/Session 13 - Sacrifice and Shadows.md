**Day One: Echoes and Plans**

Back at the Thistle home, the party debriefed after the Emerald Bank heist. With the Hammer of Elandria now in their possession, they debated next steps and reached out to Dr. Bixby Wizzlethorpe. His letter brought mixed news: Velara's safety brought him joy, but goblin raids had begun again near Southaven. For now, the town was holding.

The party asked Tilly to find Ithilwen so they could speak with her about the hammer. Finn mentioned a half-remembered prophecy involving a hammer, a ring, and a crown, though details were hazy. The day ended with cautious optimism—and growing unease.

**Day Two: Ashes, Absences, and a Knock**

The next morning, Lirielle and Ferinthria visited the library to research the prophecy. The only result was a halfling winter song—not exactly what they hoped for. Worse, entire sections related to Vel Seryn and divine lore had been cleared out. When they investigated the restricted section, they found it burned. Workers were hauling away carts of ash.

Back at the Thistle home, Tilly revealed she couldn't find Ithilwen. No one had seen her. As the party sat together, Momeline explored the house and uncovered a stack of old children's drawings. When she showed them to Finn and Tilly, Tilly quietly left the room in tears. Finn explained they once had a daughter—lost long ago.

That night, a knock came at the door. It was Yuki Song. Desperate and afraid, she revealed that Ithilwen had been taken. Her sources pointed to the old wells beneath Lusteris, where something unnatural was stirring. The party agreed to help.

**Into the Wells**

In the first chamber, the party fought off corrupted water elementals emerging from a portal. Finn and Tilly stayed behind to hold the line, with Velara and Lyrian guarding them. The rest pushed forward.

They discovered Ithilwen's hidden note to Dravencoles, warning him that the ring he wore was warping his mind. Momeline immediately tore it from his finger. In a damp study, they found a book detailing the ritual needed to resurrect the Black Architect, and the role Ithilwen would play in it.

In the altar room, they defeated the spirits of two fallen priests and uncovered a hidden passage. Inside, they ambushed the Banshee Princess, Thalara Vess. Despite their initial burst of damage, her banshee scream nearly killed Lirielle and Leonard. Ferinthria and Momeline took her down before she could strike again. Dravencoles quickly stabilized his allies.

**The Ritual Begins**

At the heart of the dungeon, they found Ithilwen bound before a throne of obsidian water. Malrith Kelbirn sat upon it, flanked by Zahir and Eirik. Yuki stood with them. The ritual began.

As four cultists took their own lives to open the Circle, Ithilwen reached out telepathically to Dravencoles: _“Take the hammer and flee. He doesn't know you have it.”_

When she erupted in blinding light, Momeline grabbed the hammer and ran. Dravencoles hesitated but followed. Ferinthria approached Ithilwen, who cast _Command_ to force her to flee. Leonard, badly injured, struggled to keep up.

Behind them, the ritual was completed. Malrith struck Ithilwen down.

The party reunited with Finn, Tilly, and the others and escaped as the wells collapsed. The resurrection had begun.

But one did not make it out—Leonard fell behind in the chaos, lost to the collapsing depths.

With the resurrection all but complete, the party must now decide what to do next. Southaven is under attack. The First Shrine calls to Dravencoles. And somewhere, Vel Seryn may hold the key to reclaiming The Ring of Silver Water.

There's no time to mourn. Only time to move.
