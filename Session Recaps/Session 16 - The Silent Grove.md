summary: While investigating the corrupted grove of Vael'telor, the party uncovered
  deadly traps, survived an ambush by a dire wolf and a silence-wielding boss, and
  cleansed a tainted druidic spring by destroying a dark crystal. Lirielle recovered
  a strange staff from a fallen druid, which later reacted to ancient runes in a hidden
  cave. After Momeline's mushroom-induced revelation, Lirielle spoke key elvish words
  that opened a sealed door, revealing a frightened druid initiate named Talan Windfern.
  Though he recognized the staff as his master's, Lirielle refused to return it. Back
  in Balandel, Queen Sylanthiel granted the group access to the city, and the Thistles
  shared new research on Vel Seryn. Meanwhile, a waiter named Garrin Dace asked for
  their help locating his missing friend, last seen near the Crypt of House Vaelrin.
  They also received a message from Wizzlethorpe, who confirmed he never sent Granny
  Louise, though the Culinary Guild is real—and he'll be arriving in Balandel soon.

At the edge of the druid grove, the party began their descent into the corrupted heart of the glen. [[Momeline Sweetwater]] scouted ahead, climbing a 20-foot bluff to gain a vantage point. From the top, she spotted humanoid footprints and a deadly trap, a tripwire in the gulch below, rigged to unleash a cascade of boulders. She warned the others and suggested a safer route.

[[Dravencoles]] led the way, but misfortune struck—he stepped on a hidden mine and was hurled violently against the canyon wall. Shaken but alive, the party pressed forward, crossing a shallow creek. There, [[Lirielle]] discovered the body of a dead druid clutching an unusual staff. She claimed it, sensing it held power.

They took cover behind a ridge, and [[Momeline Sweetwater]] slipped ahead once more. But the ambush was already in motion. A dire wolf pounced, mauling her before the rest of the party could respond. [[Lirielle]] and [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] leapt into action, launching Scorching Ray and Magic Missile.

Then, the true threat emerged: a heavily armored boss figure appeared and activated a device on his chest, unleashing a magical silence field. Lirielle and Ferinthria suddenly found themselves unable to cast most spells. He struck at both Ferinthria and Dravencoles, injuring the former, but missing the latter.

With magic limited, the party turned to melee. Lirielle cleverly used _Ice Knife_—one of the few spells that could still function—and struck true. The explosion wounded the boss but spared Dravencoles, who was narrowly out of range. The enemy tried to flee, but Dravencoles pursued and delivered the final blow.

After the battle, Momeline pried a tooth from the dire wolf as a keepsake. Lirielle discovered a rare **Blinking Toadstool**—one of the alchemical ingredients Dr. Wizzlethorpe had asked them to collect. Near the base of a waterfall, they found ancient druidic runes and a cave entrance hidden behind the water.

Inside, the cave pulsed with dark energy. A sinister crystal hovered above a pool, its magic damaging Dravencoles just by proximity. When he tried to grasp it, the pain intensified. Lirielle destroyed the crystal with a barrage of Magic Missiles, shattering it in his hands. As it broke, the corrupted water began to purify.

Vine blights attacked from the shadows but were dispatched swiftly. Within the chamber, the walls were etched with ancient druid runes—some matching those found outside. The mysterious staff began to glow faintly near certain symbols, though their meaning remained unclear.

Then, Momeline (for reasons only Momeline understands) ate a mushroom she found. The resulting hallucinations led to an impassioned monologue about wishing she could speak Elvish like the others. This sparked a realization in Lirielle, who spoke the words “sun,” “moon,” “water,” and “wind” in Elvish. The runes glowed, and a hidden door opened.

Inside, they found a frightened druid initiate named [[Talan Windfern]]. He recognized the staff Lirielle carried as his master's, but she refused to give it up—still wary after what happened with Granny Louise. Talan agreed to return to Balandel with them and offer what aid he could to the Master Druids.

On their way back to Balandel, Lirielle's familiar returned with a response from Dr. [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe|Wizzlethorpe]]: he had never asked anyone to keep an eye out for them and had no idea who Granny Louise was. The Culinary Guild of the Wandering Flame is legitimate, however, and he referred them to a renowned patisserie in Balandel for further inquiries. He also mentioned he would be arriving in the city soon.

Back in the elven city, Queen Sylanthiel spoke with them again. Lirielle noted her touching a peculiar ring during the conversation. Whatever it meant, the queen formally granted them free access to the city.

At the tavern, the Thistles shared new findings about Vel Seryn and its ancient magic. Then, a waiter named **Garrin Dace** approached the group. His friend, **Alith Vaelrin**, had gone missing—last seen visiting his family's remains in the **Crypt of House Vaelrin**. He asked the party for help.
