summary: 'At the Scarlet Shield Tavern, the party regrouped with Talan and Dessie,
  while Dr. Wizzlethorpe arrived bearing grim news: Southaven faced rising attacks,
  Solaris was silent, and he''d been robbed (likely by the Durns). The next morning,
  Velara was arrested for murdering Queen Aelra''s advisor. Though the Queen had received
  reports from Lusteris accusing the party of treason, they convinced her to secretly
  visit Velara in prison. There, Velara''s alibi and magical evidence pointed suspicion
  toward Ambassador Sylvara. At the Vess estate, the party found signs of blood magic,
  a strained note, and bandit interference. They then persuaded the Queen to meet
  Sylvara for lunch, spiking her drink with truth serum. As Lirielle had foreseen,
  Sylvara confessed: Dessie was the killer. Realizing her mistake, she attacked, but
  the party defeated her. In the temple where the battle took place, they found an
  odd note and a magical artifact. Dessie was later arrested and it was revealed that
  the flower in her hair concealed her undead nature.'

The night began in the familiar warmth of the [[Scarlet Shield Tavern]], where the party briefly reunited and debriefed. After [[Velara Kael|Velara]] retired for the night, [[Talan Windfern]] and [[Dessie Pindlehop]] arrived. Talan shared that he'd spoken with the druids at [[Balandel Enclave]], who were thankful for the party's efforts, but insisted they now had things under control. The druids seemed especially fond of Dessie, giving her a flower to wear in her hair.

[[Garrin Dace]] eventually left, and the innkeeper approached to offer thanks and drinks on the house. With spirits a bit higher, the group drank and celebrated until one by one, Talan, [[Tilly Thistle|Tilly]], [[Finnathan Thistle|Finn]], and Dessie turned in for the night.

Suddenly, a man burst through the tavern doors, none other than [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe]], arriving at last. He shared troubling news: [[Southaven]] is under increasing threat from bandit attacks, prompting him to seek [[Balandel]]'s help. [[Solaris]] remains unresponsive to calls for aid, and another ambassador had been sent there. Worse still, Wizzlethorpe was ambushed on the road by a boy and two dazed individuals, who the party suspected to be the Durns ([[Jesse Durn]], [[Tessa Durn]], and [[Kaelen Rynn]]).

The next morning, panic struck: Talan burst into the tavern, reporting that Velara had been **arrested**. En route to the prison, the party was intercepted by royal guards and taken before [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel]].

There, the Queen revealed devastating accusations: Velara was being charged with the murder of Eleanor Vess, her chief advisor. The Queen had also received troubling news from [[Lusteris]], [[Zahir Tariq]] had taken control, [[Eirik Ravenskald]] was executed for treason, and the party was accused of aiding rebels. Though skeptical, the Queen found parts of their story consistent with what her own agents confirmed. The three ambassadors of [[Circle of Verdant Flame]], [[Serelion Thorneweave]], [[Sylvara Greenthorn]], and [[Irielle Duskwhisper]], advised she jail the party outright.

Instead, the party proposed a compromise: let the Queen visit Velara invisible, to hear her story without bias. At the prison, they subtly warned Velara to choose her words carefully. Velara explained she'd been following the Queen, who had entered a hidden room using a golden key, proof that she could not have committed the murder. She also revealed that Sylvara seemed to know exactly where she was hiding. [[Dravencoles]] suggested the knife used in the murder might have a tracking spell. [[Lirielle]] confirmed this via *Detect Magic*, shocking the Queen, who left immediately.

The party investigated the destroyed Vess estate and found:  
- Small footprints  
- A strained note referencing tension with Serelion  
- Evidence of **blood magic**, **truth serum**, and **snake venom**  
- A Vess heirloom  
- Bandits looting the place (who were swiftly dealt with)

Back at the castle, the party urged the Queen to arrange a private lunch with Sylvara, suggesting it as an opportunity to draw out the truth. A dose of truth serum was slipped into the wine, subtle and undetectable. Lirielle, guided by a powerful vision from the night before, had a sense, near certainty, that Sylvara would be unable to resist its effects.

During the meal, Sylvara drank.

As the conversation turned to the murder, she began to speak more freely. Then, without prompting or hesitation, she revealed the name of the killer: Dessie Pindlehop—the same halfling Serelion had taken a particular interest in.

The Queen froze.

A heartbeat later, Sylvara seemed to realize what she had just admitted. Her eyes narrowed, and her hand moved for her blade.

Moments later, steel and magic filled the room. [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] acted instantly, delivering a devastating **Assassinate**. [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] and Lirielle unleashed powerful magic (though Lirielle's spells had trouble landing). The Queen conjured a spectral sword and struck with fury, and Dravencoles followed with a **Divine Smite**. Sylvara retaliated brutally, wounding Momeline and unleashing a psychic blast that charmed Dravencoles. Momeline struck the final blow, killing her.

The fight occurred in the church of [[Pantheon#Faeren, God of Nature and Balance|Faeren]]. There, the party found a note:  
> “Her trigger phrase is *‘The architect is calling on you to serve.'*”

Dravencoles also discovered a Stone of Earth Elemental Control hidden in the sanctuary.

Back at the tavern, guards arrived to arrest Dessie. Lirielle cast *Detect Magic* and realized the flower in her hair was enchanted to mask her undead nature. When the charm was removed, Dravencoles confirmed it: Dessie was already undead, likely turned by the cultists before they ever rescued her.
