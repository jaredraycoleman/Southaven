summary: With a new ally, the rogue Momeline Sweetwater, the party followed their
  leads to the Southaven Mines, where they were betrayed by Gareth Voss, the foreman,
  and ambushed by bandits. They fought back, but Gareth escaped. Inside the mines,
  they defeated Korvash, a bandit leader, and uncovered a disturbing letter from "Blacksoul
  S.", which listed grisly ingredients - remains of the dead, severed hands, and pyre
  ash - meant for some dark purpose. Deeper in the abandoned tunnels, the party battled
  shadowy spirits and bats before uncovering an Echoing Shard, one of the rare ingredients
  Wizzlethorpe had asked for. Returning to town, they confronted the alchemist about
  his marked ingredients found in the mines. He was surprised but mentioned his assistant,
  Mira Fallbrook, had sold ingredients recently - an unusual occurrence. Before they
  could rest, a desperate couple arrived at Lord Kael's keep - their baby had been
  kidnapped. Witnesses saw figures heading toward Blacktide Swamp, deepening the mystery.
  After negotiating their reward, the party prepared to set out, knowing that the
  darkness surrounding Southaven was only growing stronger.

The day began with a new face at [[Rusty's Tavern]]. [[Momeline Sweetwater]], a halfling rogue from Brandyburrow, had been listening to the stories of Southaven's troubles and decided it was the perfect chance to embark on the kind of adventure she'd always dreamed of. After a round of introductions over drinks, she joined the party, eager to prove herself.

Before setting out, the adventurers returned to [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe]], who provided them with [[Bixby's Cocktails|a list of rare alchemical ingredients]] to keep an eye out for. With that in mind, they turned their attention to the map found in the cultist hideout and sought an audience with [[Lord Elrin Kael|Lord Kael]]. Troubled by their findings, he offered them 25 gold to investigate [[The Southaven Mines]], one of the marked locations.

### The Mines and the Bandits

The descent into the mines was anything but welcoming. [[Gareth Voss]], the foreman, greeted them nervously but still allowed them to enter. It was a trap. Before they could explore further, a group of bandits surrounded them, demanding they surrender their weapons.

Unwilling to negotiate with outlaws, the party struck first. The battle was brutal, with the bandits and thugs falling one by one. In the chaos, Gareth managed to slip away. Pressing onward, they encountered a bandit leader named Korvash. He attempted to talk, perhaps to strike a deal or buy time, but [[Dravencoles]] had no patience for his words. Blades and spells answered instead, and Korvash fell before he could bargain his way out.

On his body, they found a chilling note, signed by "[[Blacksoul Silas|Blacksoul S.]]", listing a macabre collection of ingredients (marrow from long-dead graves, hands of the condemned, ashes of oathbreakers, and some other more common fare) all in the name of some "[[Order of the Black Star|Back Star]]."

Beyond that, the mines yielded other treasures:
- A stash of alchemical ingredients marked with Dr. Wizzlethorpe's seal.
- A Potion of Invisibility, cleverly hidden in a secret compartment.
- A vial of drow poison, though they had yet to identify it.
- Two healing potions—always a welcome find.

The deeper they ventured into the abandoned sections of the mine, the more the past seemed to linger. Shadows clung to the walls, and eerie whispers brushed against their ears. They soon discovered why. Shadowy spirits, drawn from the darkness, swirled to attack, accompanied by a horde of shrieking bats. The battle was frantic, but the adventurers triumphed, driving back their foes.

Amidst the wreckage, they found an Echoing Shard, one of the rare ingredients [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe|Wizzlethorpe]] had requested. It pulsed with a strange energy, as if it still carried the echoes of those long gone.

### Back in Southaven

The party confronted Dr. Wizzlethorpe about his ingredients being found in the mines. The eccentric alchemist was baffled. He confirmed they were his but had no idea how they ended up there. He mentioned that his assistant, [[Mira Fallbrook]], had once mentioned selling ingredients. This was a rare occurrence, as he typically only purchased supplies. He also mentioned she would be returning from a trip to [[Solaris]] in the morning.

Pleased with the Echoing Shard, Wizzlethorpe rewarded them with their first alchemical cocktail, granting Dravencoles an uncanny silver tongue for the next day.

Before they could celebrate, they decided to check in with [[Lord Elrin Kael|Lord Kael]]. As they approached the keep, they saw a couple leaving in tears. [[Lord Elrin Kael|Lord Kael]] delivered grim news: their baby had been kidnapped, taken by unknown figures who were last seen heading toward [[Blacktide Swamp]]. The urgency of their quest deepened.

Lord Kael initially offered 25 gold for the rescue, but after persistent haggling from [[Lirielle]], [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]], and [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]], they managed to raise the reward to 40. The nobleman, however, grew visibly irritated by their relentless bargaining. Meanwhile, [[Dravencoles]] stood silently aside, his expression tinged with embarrassment, perhaps due to his paladin's sense of honor, which made such negotiations feel inappropriate given the gravity of a kidnapped child.

With another mission ahead, they retired to [[Rusty's Tavern]] to rest, knowing that the coming days would test them like never before.
