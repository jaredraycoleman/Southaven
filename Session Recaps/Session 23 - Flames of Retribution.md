The session began at the [[Scarlet Shield Tavern]], where the party gathered their thoughts and prepared for the day ahead. Their first destination was the Queen's palace, where they intended to check on [[Talan Windfern]] in the secret questioning chamber. However, upon arrival, they noticed druids of the flame watching them closely. [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] quickly bluffed, claiming they were there to see [[Elarin Vess]]. A druid escorted them to his guest chambers, where they convinced Elarin to meet with the Queen using the Twin Orb of Passage.

During the meeting, the party successfully persuaded Elarin that [[Archdruid Thalwen Myr]]'s extremist views could lead to the downfall of [[Vel Enweir]]. Despite their suspicions of her collusion with cultists, Elarin remained skeptical. He also revealed that the druids had discovered the secret chamber with Talan inside.

[[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] turned Momeline invisible, allowing her to investigate the chamber. She overheard druids expressing disgust at the Queen's use of such a facility. Outside, she caught a conversation where the Archdruid dispatched druids to [[Saint Andral's Church]] to find [[Irielle Duskwhisper]] and to guard Talan at their camp, expressing frustration over [[Malrec]]'s death.

The party then traveled to Saint Andral's Church, located a few hours outside [[Balandel]]. Upon arrival, the priest requested a tithe from [[Dravencoles]], who generously donated 100 gold. Their visit was interrupted by the arrival of the Crimson Watchmen, whose presence quickly turned hostile.

A battle ensued at the door of the church. [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] slipped past the watchmen and unleashed a devastating fireball. [[Lirielle]] followed up with precise Magic Missiles, while Momeline executed a deadly sneak attack. [[Dravencoles]] finished the fight with a powerful divine smite, vanquishing the remaining foes. The priest thanked them, though he expressed concern about potential retribution.

The priest then invited Dravencoles to visit Saint Andral's tomb beneath the church. There, Dravencoles experienced a vision of himself poised to strike Talan, only to hear a voice reminding him, "Mercy is Light. Without it, even the brightest flame burns hollow."

Their journey continued to a nearby farm, where they encountered a cave infested with corrupted blooms. Momeline bravely entered first, but an alchemist's fire she threw caused an explosion, rendering her unconscious. The rest of the party rushed to her aid. [[Dravencoles]] was the first to reach her, cutting away a plant that threatened to smother her. [[Lirielle]] and Ferinthria joined the fray, and together they discovered the bloom's vulnerability to fire and radiant damage. After defeating the giant corrupted bloom, they collected seeds for further study and informed the farmer of their success.
