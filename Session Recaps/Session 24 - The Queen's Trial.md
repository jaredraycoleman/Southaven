summary: The party informed Father Tironiel about the corrupted blooms' weakness to radiant damage, then returned to rescue Talan Windfern from the fire druid camp. Despite Dravencoles triggering a fire rune explosion, they successfully extracted Talan, who wild shaped into a blackbird while Lirielle and Ferinthria cast distracting spells. Back in Balandel, they learned the Queen's lawyer had been assassinated, prompting Momeline to step up as lead defense counsel for the trial. After getting Talan drunk to make him a poor witness and sneaking the Twin Orb of Passage into the courtroom as an escape route, Momeline mounted a successful defense, shocking the Archdruid when her own apprentice Elarin testified against her. Just as the Queen's innocence seemed assured, the Durns attacked from the rafters, but Momeline quickly teleported the Queen to safety while the party fought off the assassins, with Dravencoles delivering the killing blow to Kaelen Rynn. The jury unanimously declared the Queen innocent, and she recommitted 200 troops to help defend Southaven against the goblin raids.

The party wasted no time sharing what they had learned. [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] told Father Tironiel at [[Saint Andral's Church]] about radiant damage being effective against the corrupted blooms. In return, the priest gave [[Dravencoles]] a charm of Saint Andral to remember the virtue of Mercy.

Their next task was clear but dangerous: rescue [[Talan Windfern]] from the druids of the flame. The party returned to the fire druid camp outside [[Balandel]], where Dravencoles accidentally triggered one of their fire runes while approaching the river. The explosion launched him into a tree, where he managed to hide. Meanwhile, Momeline crept to Talan's tent and poked her head inside. The nervous druid was hesitant at first, but she convinced him to escape with them. He wild shaped into a small blackbird and followed her out. [[Lirielle]] and [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] cast distracting spells to mislead the searching druids, and the party fled into the forest. Behind them, smoke and flames rose as the enraged druids burned everything in their fury.

Back at the [[Scarlet Shield Tavern]], [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe|Wizzlethorpe]] delivered grim news: the Queen's lawyer had been assassinated, and their firm burned to the ground. The party visited the charred remains of the building and spoke with [[Velara Kael|Velara]], who was gathering information. No one knew exactly what happened, but many suspected the druids of the flame. The party asked Velara to try to find a replacement lawyer.

With the trial looming, the party visited [[Queen Aelra Sylanthiel|Queen Aelra]] to discuss her options. The Queen declared that one of them must represent her in court—no lawyer would understand the stakes or the full scope of the case. Momeline stepped forward and agreed to lead the defense.

Talan revealed that the druids had taken him from the Queen's questioning chamber (where he had not been tortured) and wanted him to testify against her. After hearing the party's story, he believed them and decided to take their side. However, he worried that his nervous personality would make him a poor witness. The party decided to get him drunk, and Wizzlethorpe was tasked with keeping him up all night to ensure he would be useless on the stand.

The next morning, as they entered the [[Balandel Courthouse]], Ferinthria and Lirielle noticed the Twin Orb of Passage sitting inconspicuously next to the Queen. To most, it appeared to be mere decoration, but the party knew better—it was an escape route if things went south.

In the courtroom, Momeline, dressed in her finest lawyer attire, delivered opening statements and called witnesses: Talan, [[Elarin Vess]], and [[Serelion Thorneweave]]. The party consistently made strong arguments. The highlights included [[Archdruid Thalwen Myr]]'s shock when Elarin—her own former apprentice—testified that he didn't believe the [[Ring of Verdant Stillness]] was real, and Dravencoles discrediting the Archdruid by pointing out that all her evidence relied on cultist testimony.

Just as it became clear the Queen would be found innocent, an arrow flew from the rafters and struck her. Momeline thought quickly, placing the orb of passage in the Queen's hands. She vanished.

The Archdruid was furious. The party worked together to bring down the attackers, who they soon realized were the Durns. [[Kaelen Rynn]] leaped down from the rafters and began attacking while [[Tessa Durn]] and [[Jesse Durn]] fired from above. Powerful chromatic orbs from Ferinthria and Lirielle sent the scouts tumbling from the rafters. Jesse and Tessa escaped, but Dravencoles struck Kaelen down with a devastating divine smite.

When the chaos settled, the jury unanimously voted that the Queen was innocent. After order was restored, she recommitted 200 troops to accompany the party and Wizzlethorpe to [[Southaven]] to defend against the goblin raids.

Later, [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]]'s wild magic accidentally transformed her into a marijuana plant. Ever resourceful, she made gummies from the leaves and offered some to Talan, who had been visibly anxious throughout the trial. After partaking, the perpetually frightened druid became noticeably more relaxed.
