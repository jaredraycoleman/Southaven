summary: "The party devised a daring plan to reach Aramond's Lookout: sending Landor to threaten the northern blockade as a distraction while they slipped down the river under cover of the trees. Sneaking past distracted goblins and an ogre guard, they infiltrated the stronghold and confronted Ghorzak the Red and Zigra. When Momeline convinced the goblins to turn on their hobgoblin commander, a chaotic battle erupted. A mysterious snake-creature fled, Talan fell unconscious from venomous wounds that required holy magic to heal, and cultists joined the fray before fleeing into dark smoke. In the aftermath, Zigra agreed to leave the valley and return to the Pale Mountains, though her promise to kill dwarves left the party uneasy."

The party sent [[Landor Vess|Landor]] north to threaten the blockade as a distraction while they slipped down the River Aramond under cover of trees. Along the way they nearly stumbled upon goblins engaged in compromising activities—[[Lirielle]] stepped on a twig that almost gave them away, but the distracted guards returned to their business.

Reaching [[Aramond's Lookout]], they found dozens of tents and an ogre guarding the gate. [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] made [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] invisible and Lirielle used magic to imitate a goblin's voice, calling guards away from a side entrance. Momeline's invisibility dropped just as she reached the door, forcing the party to rush across open ground as the guards returned. They made it through with seconds to spare.

Inside, they found [[Ghorzak the Red]] with [[Zigra]] and a strange scaly humanoid. Zigra accused them of causing her father's death, but they convinced her they had protected the goblin women and children. She believed them, but Ghorzak's patience snapped. He threw Zigra against the wall and called his guards to arrest the party. 

Momeline turned to the goblins and convinced them to protect Zigra instead. Zigra gave the counter-order: arrest Ghorzak. The goblins chose her.

The scaly creature transformed into a serpent and fled through an arrow slit. [[Talan Windfern]] wild shaped into a bird and chased it but returned moments later, unconscious and poisoned. Ghorzak decapitated two goblins and charged the party. [[Velara Kael|Velara]] wrestled the snake-creature while the others fought. A cultist joined the battle, but when Ghorzak fell, he fled. [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]], [[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]], and [[Dravencoles]] gave chase.

Lirielle stayed behind and tried healing potions on Talan, but they didn't work. Zigra's magic failed too. Ferinthria sensed something wrong, abandoned the chase, and channeled holy energy into him. It worked, barely. They called Dravencoles back, and the paladin's radiant magic pulled Talan from death's door.

In another chamber, they found the fleeing cultist with a more powerful companion casting a dark ritual. Before they could reach him, he dissolved into black smoke and escaped.

The party spoke with Zigra, who agreed to leave [[Windcrest Valley]] and return to the [[Pale Mountains]]—though her promise to kill dwarves there left them uneasy. Lirielle stuffed the serpent-creature into her component pouch to prevent its escape.
