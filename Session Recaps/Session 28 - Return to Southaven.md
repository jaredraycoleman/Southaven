summary: After resting at Aramond's Lookout, the party snuck back into Southaven under cover of midnight and reunited with Lord Kael and Brenlan in an emotional homecoming marred by the news of Lord Tywin's death. They lit a beacon to signal Landor's army, and when the attack began on the northern blockade, struck the southern camp with devastating magic, freeing prisoners Gareth Voss and Harlan Drexel while letting the dangerous Rothgar Red Hand escape. Just as victory seemed within reach, a massive hydra emerged from the darkness and tore through Southaven's defenses. Though the party fought desperately and brought down the beast in the heart of the keep, much of the town lay in ruins, and the battle was far from over.

The party took a long rest at [[Aramond's Lookout]], recovering from their confrontation with [[Ghorzak the Red]]. As midnight approached, they made their way back to [[Southaven]] under cover of darkness, avoiding the bandit camps that still gripped the valley.

Inside the town, they found [[Lord Elrin Kael]] and [[Brenlan Kael|Brenlan]], who were elated to see [[Velara Kael|Velara]]. The reunion was warm but shadowed by loss. [[Elen Tywin]] and her daughter [[Vanessa Tywin|Vanessa]] stood nearby, grief-stricken and hollow-eyed. When Vanessa asked if they had found her father, the party confirmed what she feared: Lord Tywin was dead, executed by goblins at the lookout. In a small mercy, [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] returned Vanessa's small dog, [[Beefy]], alive and well. The girl clutched the dog tightly, and for a moment, the weight of the siege seemed to lift from her shoulders.

The party's plan was clear: signal [[Landor Vess|Landor]] to begin his assault on the northern blockade. They lit the beacon on the walls, but when no response came, they sent [[Talan Windfern]] to deliver the message directly. Within the hour, Landor's forces struck. The sounds of battle echoed from the north as the bandits scrambled to defend their position. Seizing the moment, the party moved south to sabotage the blockade from behind.

[[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]] struck first. Her fireball incinerated four bandits in an instant. [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]] loosed her last [[Bolts of Shadow's Mark]], and with the majority of the enemy forces distracted by Landor's assault, the southern camp fell quickly.

In the chaos, they found [[Rothgar Red-Hand]] standing over caged prisoners, crossbow aimed and finger on the trigger. "Let me walk," he snarled, "or they die." The party let him flee. The prisoners were [[Gareth Voss]] and [[Harlan Drexel]], both weakened but alive. As they helped them to their feet, a bone-rattling screech split the air: A hydra was attacking Southaven.

The creature tore through the town, a mass of thrashing heads and scaled fury. Buildings collapsed under its weight. Guards fell. [[Dravencoles]] summoned his divine steed, pulled Momeline up behind him, and rode at full gallop to intercept. [[Lirielle]] and Ferinthria followed close behind.

The fight was brutal. The party quickly realized that fire was the key. Flames scorched scales, and radiant light seared flesh. The hydra smashed through the walls of the keep, scattering defenders and crushing stone beneath its bulk, but the party pressed the assault. One by one, the heads fell and did not rise again. When the last head dropped, the hydra collapsed in the courtyard of the keep, its massive corpse steaming in the firelight. Around them, Southaven burned. Guards shouted orders. Civilians screamed.
