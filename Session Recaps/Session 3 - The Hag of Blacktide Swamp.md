With little time to spare, the party set off under the cover of night, following the trail toward Blacktide Swamp. Though the darkness and treacherous terrain made travel difficult, they navigated their way with determination, driven by the urgency of their mission.

As they neared the swamp, they spotted flickering flames in the distance. Moving carefully, they discovered a group of cultists gathered around a roaring bonfire, their voices raised in a guttural chant. Without hesitation, the adventurers launched an ambush.

The battle was swift and decisive, the party cutting through the cultists before they could complete their dark ritual. As one of the fallen breathed his last, he gasped a cryptic name: "The Architect." The meaning of this ominous title remained unclear, but the weight of it left a lingering sense of unease.

Among the cultists' belongings, they discovered magical scrolls designed to reveal hidden places—specifically, the lair of the swamp's notorious hag. Their path led them deeper into the murky wetlands, where they encountered an enormous crocodile lurking beneath the surface. The beast lunged, but the party prevailed, its hide no match for their blades and spells. After the battle, Momeline Sweetwater took several of its teeth as trophies.

At last, the spell led them to the hag's dilapidated hut, barely visible through the thick fog. Ever the stealthy rogue, Momeline attempted to sneak around for a better vantage point, peeking through the grimy window. However, fate had other plans—her foot caught on a hidden cellar door, and as she stumbled, the hag's piercing eyes locked onto her. A wicked grin spread across the crone's face as she beckoned her undead minions to attack.

From both sides of the hut, two zombies and a monstrous Ogre Zombie emerged, flanking the party in a brutal assault.

Dravencoles wielded his Warhammer with divine might, smiting one zombie into oblivion.

Lirielle, Ferinthria, and her wolf companion worked together to take down the second.

The Ogre Zombie, however, proved far more resilient. It took all their combined strength to bring it down, with Momeline landing the final, decisive blow.

The party turned their attention to the cellar, but its door was sealed by powerful magic. There was only one way forward—through the hag herself.

Inside the hut, the hag awaited them, her twisted smile revealing rotten, yellow teeth. She offered a deal—her life in exchange for a powerful potion of great and terrible power. She swore that if they spared her, she would leave the swamp and never return. While Ferinthria kept the hag distracted, Momeline quietly slipped behind her, lifting the baby from a crude wooden crib and slipping out of the house unnoticed.

For a moment, the party hesitated. Was it wiser to take the potion and be rid of her? Or was she lying, merely stalling for time?

Ultimately, their decision was unanimous: she had to die.

Dravencoles stepped forward, divine energy crackling in his grasp, and delivered the final blow. The hag let out a piercing shriek before crumpling to the floor, her body dissolving into a pile of withered bones and blackened cloth.

Saving the Children

With the hag vanquished, the magic on the cellar door faded. Inside, they discovered several other missing children. Though frightened and malnourished, they were alive. The party gathered them up and made their way back to Southaven, their mission complete.

As they returned to town, they were met with cheers and relief. The grieving parents wept with joy as they were reunited with their lost children. Lord Kael, despite his previous frustration with their bargaining, acknowledged their bravery and heroism and invited them to a feast in their honor at the keep.

At the feast, they were introduced to Lord Kael's children, Brenlan and Velara.

Brenlan, wide-eyed and eager, bombarded them with questions about their adventures and battles.

Velara, more reserved and intensely observant, watched the group carefully, seemingly analyzing every detail.

Momeline gifted both of them crocodile teeth as souvenirs. Brenlan was thrilled, immediately imagining tales of battling swamp beasts, while Velara was amused and grateful for the token.

After an evening of feasting, storytelling, and recognition, the party returned to Rusty's Tavern, where a bard had already begun composing a song of their heroism. To Ferinthria's slight embarrassment, the bard's tale included her persistent haggling with Lord Kael. Wanting to change the tone of the evening, she bought drinks for everyone in the tavern, attempting to show her generosity instead.

As the melodies of their victory echoed through the hall, the adventurers took a well-earned rest—knowing that whatever dark forces still lurked in the shadows, Southaven would not fall so easily.

### Fun Facts Shared

As the night went on, the adventurers shared lighthearted stories about themselves:

Lirielle revealed that she once had a fling with Ferinthria's cousin, who had visited Fadrín from Balandél when they were younger.

Dravencoles reminisced about his childhood in the mountains, where he spent time playing and fishing in the streams.

Ferinthria shared that she had no siblings, though she did have many cousins. She spent much of her youth alone in the forest, forming a deep connection with animals and learning to speak with them.

Momeline surprised the group by revealing that she was adopted—her mother is an elf and her father is a human, both of whom chose to settle in Brandyburrow and live among the hobbits there.

As the melodies of their victory echoed through the hall, the adventurers took a well-earned rest—knowing that whatever dark forces still lurked in the shadows, Southaven would not fall so easily.

### Bard's Song

> Oh, gather ye close and lend me your ears,
> For a tale of great deeds and adventuring cheers!
> A band of fine heroes, both fearless and bold,
> Who'd haggle a prince for a handful of gold!
> 
> In Southaven town, they answered the call,
> To chase down the fiends who had taken a small,
> Through swamps full of horrors, they waded knee-deep,
> And found a vile hag with a child she did keep!
> 
> With swords and with spells, they stormed through the night,
> Their wallets stayed tight, but they won the great fight!
> They bargained, they battled, they haggled for pay,
> And saved that poor babe at the end of the fray!
> 
> So raise up your tankards, and drink without fear,
> For the heroes of Southaven, let's give them a cheer!
> Whether slaying or haggling, their legend is spun,
> And by all the gods, they're a handful—but fun!
