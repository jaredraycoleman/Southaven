summary: While assisting Dr. Bixby Wizzlethorpe, the party unwittingly exposed his
  assistant, Mira Fallbrook, as a traitor. She trapped Wizzlethorpe in a bottle, summoned
  enchanted guardians to fight the party, and fled. After a fierce battle, they found
  her in the back room, frantically searching for something. Near death, she drank
  a Flamejump Elixir, immolating herself and destroying Wizzlethorpe's prison, freeing
  him. The alchemist was horrified—such a potion required cruelty against phoenixes,
  but where had she obtained it?Investigating Mira's ledger, Momeline discovered shipments
  sent to Duskwatch. Wizzlethorpe promised to research further, and a few days later,
  he finally pinpointed the approximate location of Duskwatch Keep—deep in the Pale
  Mountains, five days' travel from Southaven.However, before they could plan their
  next move, a man named Donavar arrived at Rusty's Tavern with a chilling ultimatum.
  He had stolen Ferinthria's wolf and demanded they steal Lord Elric's signet ring
  if they wanted it back. Before leaving, he cryptically warned them to wait and see
  what happens tonight.As they debated their next move, chaos erupted at the town's
  festival—hooded figures stormed a tent and fled in a carriage. The party gave chase,
  using arrows and magic to take down the carriage, killing two of the assailants
  and capturing a third. But when they opened the wreckage, it was empty.Brenlan was
  missing.

After a much-needed night's rest, the party returned to [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe]], where they handed over a chittering cricket leg, one of the rare ingredients he had requested. Delighted, the eccentric alchemist brewed another of his infamous alchemical cocktails—a drink that granted Lirielle enhanced speed for the day.

Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of [[Mira Fallbrook]], Wizzlethorpe's assistant. The party attempted to subtly ask Wizzlethorpe about her, but his naïve and trusting nature led him to ask her directly about the alchemical ingredients they had found in the mines.

Mira froze, then apologized before casting a pre-prepared spell. Wizzlethorpe was instantly sucked into a glass bottle in her hands, and at the same time, three animated armors and a flying sword materialized to attack the party. She fled into the back office, closing the door behind her.

A chaotic battle erupted, shaking the alchemist's shop as spells and weapons tore through the enchanted constructs. Flasks shattered and bookshelves collapsed. After defeating the constructs, Dravencoles opened the door to the backroom, where he found Mira frantically scanning through books.

Cornered, she cast Thunderwave, sending shockwaves through the room, but the fight was already lost. Just as [[Lirielle]]'s sorcery brought her to the brink of defeat, Mira pulled out a small red vial and drank it.

The moment the elixir touched her lips, she burst into flames. The bottle holding Wizzlethorpe shattered, freeing him. Mira's body vanished, leaving only scorched clothing and papers behind.

Horrified, Wizzlethorpe identified the elixir as a Flamejump Potion: an alchemical horror that requires torturing phoenixes to create. How Mira had come to possess such a thing, he could not say, but the discovery left him deeply shaken.

As the party searched the wreckage, Momeline deciphered a ledger, revealing shipments sent to "Duskwatch." The name rang a bell for Wizzlethorpe, but he couldn't recall its meaning. He promised to investigate further with [[Roswin Brambletoe]] in the town library.

With no further leads, the party settled into a quiet routine in Southaven, but their respite was short-lived.

At a dinner at the keep, the party met Lord Kael's distant cousin, [[Lord Elric Kael]], an arrogant noble from [[Seawatch]] who had overstayed his welcome. They later bonded with [[Brenlan Kael]] over their mutual dislike of him at Rusty's Tavern. The night before Mule Days festivals, Dr. Bixby Wizzlethorpe approached them at [[Rusty's Tavern]] with crucial news. He and Roswin had finally determined the approximate location of [[Duskwatch Keep]], a five-day journey north into the [[Pale Mountains]]. The discovery confirmed that the keep was real, though its precise purpose and inhabitants remained unknown.

Their night took a darker turn when a mysterious man named [[Donavar Reddmark]] approached them. He had kidnapped [[Leonard Chesterwolfe]], offering to return it only if they stole Lord Elric's signet ring. Before leaving, he ominously told them to "wait and see what happens tonight."

As they debated, chaos erupted at the town festival. Hooded figures rushed into a tent, then escaped in a carriage. The party gave chase, managing to shoot a horse and destroy the carriage's wheels.

They killed two of the assailants and captured a third, but when they opened the carriage, they found it empty.

[[Brenlan Kael|Brenlan]] was gone.
