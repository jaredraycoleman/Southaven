summary: Upon entering Lusteris, the party aided the Obsidian Army in repelling a
  sandwraith-led undead incursion, earning a Token of Obsidian Valor. Reuniting with
  Velara Kael at the Whisper & Oak Tavern, they attended the Silver Chair Gala and
  engaged with the city's five major factions. They learned of missing priestesses,
  growing magical instability, and mounting political tensions. That night, a masked
  group disrupted the gala in the name of the oppressed poor, sparking speculation
  about Velara's ties to the city's underworld. Investigating a lead, the party assaulted
  a Black Thorn Guild warehouse, killing its members and discovering a note signed
  by “Lady V” that hinted the guild followed nonviolent principles—raising questions
  about whether they had just silenced allies rather than enemies.

Upon entering [[Lusteris]], the party aided Lieutenant Marvos in holding off a line of sandwalkers on the outskirts of the city. Marvos tasked the group with slaying the sandwraith leading the undead. Despite ineffective early strikes—[[Ferinthria Everflame|Ferinthria]]'s fire magic, [[Dravencoles]]' radiant smite, and [[Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline]]'s poison—the party discovered the creature was vulnerable to water and ice. [[Lirielle]]'s lightning attack weakened it; Ferinthria exposed its aversion to moisture; and ultimately, Leonard Chesterwolfe delivered the killing blow. With the sandwraith dead, the remaining sandwalkers crumbled. The Obsidian Army suffered minimal losses, and the party was awarded a Token of Obsidian Valor, given to Ferinthria.

Inside the city, the party found the Solara Embassy burned and located [[Velara Kael]] at the Whisper & Oak Tavern. After a brief (and awkward) reunion (including a suspicious encounter involving men's trousers in Velara's room) the party was invited to the Silver Chair Gala by Lady Serin, an ambassador from Solara.

At the gala in the ethereal Silver Palace Gardens, the party encountered each of the five major factions of Lusteris:

- [[Yuki Song]] of the Silver Chair warned them of scrutiny.
- [[Ithilwen Galandel]] of the Sapphire Temple confided in Dravencoles about missing priestesses and gifted him a medallion that detects divine corruption.
- [[Zahir Tariq]] of the Obsidian Army requested help investigating a string of high-profile murders potentially linked to thieves' guilds.
- [[Eirik Ravenskald]] of the Emerald Bank spoke in veiled threats and asked the party to report any sightings of [[Lyrian Brightwind]], an embezzler.
- [[Tilly Thistle|Tilly]] and [[Finnathan Thistle|Finnathan]] Thistle of the [[Lusteris#The Marble Academy|Marble Academy]] expressed concern about Velara and cryptic instability in divination magic. The party also learned to search the library for more information about [[Bixby Wizzlethorpe]]'s expulsion.

Momeline identified Starlit Fern Fronds, a rare alchemical reagent, growing in the garden. Ferinthria skillfully manipulated Eirik into believing she was politically aligned with him.

During the event, a bandit incursion disrupted the gala. The masked thieves demanded the wealthy guests surrender their valuables, claiming to represent the forgotten poor. The party chose to stand down. Eirik was visibly irritated, and the leader publicly mocked him.

Later that night, the group decided to investigate one of the suspects in the murders: [[The Black Thorns]]. They located a warehouse and launched an immediate and violent assault using fire magic and close-combat strikes. All present were killed. Among the wreckage, they found a note bearing the signature of Lady V, suggesting the guild followed strict, nonviolent ethical guidelines:

> "No blades unless they're drawn first. No fire unless they strike the match."

The message's tone and the signature, _Lady V_, immediately raised suspicions in Momeline and Lirielle, who speculated that Velara may be entangled in the city's underworld, either as an ally or manipulator of the Black Thorns.

The party claimed 400 gold from a hidden stockpile in the warehouse and returned to the Whisper & Oak, leaving behind smoldering ruins and a growing unease about whether the Black Thorns were truly the threat they appeared to be, or merely pawns in a larger game.
