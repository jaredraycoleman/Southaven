## Original Description

Description

Milo Puddlewick is a weathered halfling in his late thirties, his youthful features hardened by years of desert sun and combat. His blond hair, once as bright as his sister's, has faded to a sandy brown, kept short and practical. His blue eyes—the same shade as Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline's—carry a haunted look, tempered by quiet resolve.

He wears the light, flowing garb of the desert folk, with leather armor designed for mobility in harsh conditions. A curved blade hangs at his hip, and he moves with the careful alertness of someone who has spent years watching the horizon for threats.

Background

Milo was born near Clover to Jory and Tilda Puddlewick—gentle, free-spirited folk. His father was a mushroom-dyer; his mother an herbal midwife and beekeeper. When Milo was eleven, his parents joined a gatherers' caravan into the Dragonspire Mountains to harvest rare moonmilk caps. Black-cloaked riders slaughtered the caravan. Milo survived only by hiding with his three-year-old sister in a narrow shale cleft.

He carried Momeline to Brandyburrow, where the siblings were taken into Kettlewort House under Matron Bess. Two years later, the riders found them again. They stabbed Momeline on a bridge as she walked home from school. Milo, arriving too late, found only blood on the stones. He believed his sister dead.

Consumed by grief and driven by a need for answers, Milo fled—traveling west to east until he reached Khasim's Crown, a desert realm beyond the Witchwood. There, he found purpose with the Sirocco Wardens, an order dedicated to defending the oases from undead threats. He blames a necromantic cult for his family's destruction, though the true nature of the Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star and their reason for hunting his sister remain unknown to him.

He does not know that Momeline survived.

## Refined Description

A halfling in his late thirties, weathered by the desert sun and past battles. His hair, once a bright blond, is now a sandy brown, kept short and functional. His blue eyes are the color of clear skies, but reflect a history of hardship and resilience. He wears the traditional attire of desert dwellers: light, flowing garments designed for harsh climates, complemented by a set of leather armor that balances protection with mobility. At his side hangs a distinctive curved blade, hinting at his readiness for action. His build is compact yet muscular, his movements exhibiting a cautious grace, indicative of someone accustomed to constant vigilance. Despite his small stature, his presence is commanding, shaped by a life lived on the edge of survival. His skin is tanned from the sun, with fine lines hinting at both smiles and stress, giving him a rugged yet approachable appearance.
