## Original Description

Description

Milo Puddlewick is a weathered halfling in his late thirties, his youthful features hardened by years of desert sun and combat. His blond hair, once as bright as his sister's, has faded to a sandy brown, kept short and practical. His blue eyes (the same shade as Momeline Sweetwater|Momeline's) carry a haunted look, tempered by quiet resolve.

He wears the light, flowing garb of the desert folk, with leather armor designed for mobility in harsh conditions. A curved blade hangs at his hip, and he moves with the careful alertness of someone who has spent years watching the horizon for threats.

Background

Milo was born near Clover to Jory and Tilda Puddlewick—gentle, free-spirited folk. His father was a mushroom-dyer; his mother an herbal midwife and beekeeper. When Milo was eleven, his parents joined a gatherers' caravan into the Dragonspire Mountains to harvest rare moonmilk caps. Black-cloaked riders slaughtered the caravan. Milo survived only by hiding with his three-year-old sister in a narrow shale cleft.

He carried Momeline to Brandyburrow, where the siblings were taken into Kettlewort House under Matron Bess. Two years later, the riders found them again. They stabbed Momeline on a bridge as she walked home from school. Milo, arriving too late, found only blood on the stones. He believed his sister dead.

Consumed by grief and driven by a need for answers, Milo fled—traveling west to east until he reached Khasim's Crown, a desert realm beyond the Witchwood. There, he found purpose with the Sirocco Wardens, an order dedicated to defending the oases from undead threats. He blames a necromantic cult for his family's destruction, though the true nature of the Order of the Black Star|Cult of the Black Star and their reason for hunting his sister remain unknown to him.

He does not know that Momeline survived.

## Refined Description

A halfling in his late thirties, standing at about three and a half feet tall, with a sturdy build honed by years in harsh desert climates. His skin is deeply tanned, reflecting the sun-soaked life he leads. His hair is a sandy brown, cut short for practicality and ease. His eyes are blue, the shade reminiscent of a clear sky, and carry a depth that suggests many untold stories. Most notably, he has distinct, elf-like ears that add an exotic touch to his appearance. He is dressed in the light, flowing garments typical of desert dwellers, designed to keep him cool while offering protection from the sun. His attire is complemented by leather armor that emphasizes mobility. A curved blade rests at his hip, indicating readiness and experience in combat. He moves with a cautious grace, indicative of someone always on alert for possible threats.

## Prompt

He has elf-like ears, just like Momeline.
